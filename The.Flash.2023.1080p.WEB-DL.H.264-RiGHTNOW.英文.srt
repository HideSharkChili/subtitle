1
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,700
Have a brilliant day.

2
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,580
Yeah, thank you.

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,660
You too.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,950
Morning. What can I get you?

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,910
Where's curly-hair lady?

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,710
Sara?

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,790
She's out sick. Or at least, that's what she says.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,540
She's got a new boyfriend.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,590
What can I get you?

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,130
Usually it's my usual

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,760
and she usually has it ready because I'm usually late.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,630
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Um, it's a PB and BRHC on a roll.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,930
Okay, so...

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,760
-"PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming? -Yes.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,680
"BR," bananas, raisins.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,430
"H," honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,560
Aren't you blessed with a fast metabolism.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,440
Are you running a marathon or something?

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,520
You know, my sister ran a marathon once,

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,690
God rest her soul.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,150
She's not dead. She's just exhausted.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,280
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,200
But everyone has to work in the morning.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,950
Yeah, I have to go to work, three minutes ago.

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,200
And, sorry, I'm in sort of a rush for the sandwich.

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,660
You can't rush a good sandwich, dude.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,670
Alfred, really can't talk.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,300
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
No, I'm late.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,510
And I'm starving, and curly-haired girl isn't here

32
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,550
and her name is Sara, and she has a boyfriend.

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,680
We have a situation at Gotham General.

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,260
A robbery gone wrong.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,390
This is the middle of the morning.

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,560
Why is our bat-friend even awake?

37
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
Call Superman.

38
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,520
That was my first thought.

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,810
Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.

40
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,810
...active volcano in Central America.

41
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
Classic.

42
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,070
What about Diana?

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,320
My other first thought.

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Rather annoyingly, she's not picking up.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,320
How many first thoughts, exactly,

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,700
did you have before you first thought of me?

47
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,950
...never about her.

48
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,700
-This is about you. -Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,910
I learned my lesson on the boat last year.

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
Stuff my sister comes out with when she's drunk.

51
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,080
Personal comments about my mom's friends as well,

52
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,790
which I think is what I say about her...

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,890
Oh, my God!

54
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,010
Flash!

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,180
Hi.

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,930
Thank you.

57
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,310
You seem very nice also.

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,390
Oh, my God!

59
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,520
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

60
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,020
No, please don't.

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,780
Oh, my God. Sorry if this sounds weird,

62
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,690
but are you actively eating that candy bar?

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,650
Maybe you could throw it to me?

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
In the name of justice.

65
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,570
Yes, yes.

66
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
I need you here now, Barry.

67
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,530
Hi, Bruce.

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Yes, I'm...

69
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,910
coming.

70
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,770
No!

71
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,390
No, no!

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,030
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,530
Why aren't you here?

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,010
Bruce, why does it sound like you're fleeing the scene?

75
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,810
Falcone's idiot kid decided to try to play in the big leagues.

76
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,890
He put a crew together and broke into the lab at Gotham General.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,890
Stole a highly deadly virus.

78
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,270
I intercepted them, but they blasted their way out.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,940
You can handle the hospital, Barry.

80
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,400
Somebody has to save the rest of the world, so I was gonna do that.

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
If you don't mind.

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,030
Sounds about right, Bruce.

83
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,010
"Thanks for saving me from the sinkhole, Flash."

84
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,010
Barry, gas and water pipes ruptured.

85
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,760
In the basement.

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Right.

87
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,390
On it.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,160
Can you open it?

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,530
-I think it's locked. -It's jammed.

90
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,530
God, it's not working!

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,950
Oh, please!

92
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,130
Look, Alfred. I've come to accept

93
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,130
that I'm essentially the janitor of the Justice League.

94
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,380
Which sucks.

95
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,140
But I've come to accept it.

96
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,430
But...

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,140
I can't help but notice...

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,060
that it always seems to be a bat-mess...

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,770
that I'm cleaning up.

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
Look out!

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,800
If my calculations are correct,

102
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,890
and history will prove they usually are,

103
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,390
the foundational damage is

104
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,270
about to cause the collapse of the east wing.

105
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
East wing's fine.

106
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,140
All right, I got you.

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
Which is good because my speed is lagging.

108
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,310
Running on empty, Alfred.

109
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,030
Do you hear that?

110
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,320
That's my stomach.

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
No, no.

112
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,660
It's the collapsing east wing.

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,510
Barry, 30th floor.

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,510
There's a

115
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,550
baby...

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Shower.

117
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,010
Mr. Allen,

118
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,020
you've made me very proud.

119
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,640
And a lot of mothers very happy.

120
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Okay.

121
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,910
I understand

122
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,660
that these events can be psychologically scarring.

123
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,910
You should seek the services of a mental health professional.

124
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,710
The Justice League is not very good at that part yet.

125
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Trust me.

126
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,290
God.

127
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,830
Shake him off!

128
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,260
If that briefcase falls into the water,

129
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,050
it could wipe out half of Gotham by lunchtime.

130
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,510
Damn it.

131
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,060
Please don't drop me.

132
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,890
Oh, God, no. Please, please don't.

133
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,070
Sorry I'm late.

134
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,290
Watch your step.

135
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Nice suit.

136
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,590
Looking good, Flash.

137
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,210
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

138
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,050
And you...

139
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
are welcome.

140
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,510
My ego's far too big to say "thank you" to someone else.

141
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,890
I developed this... all-powerful persona

142
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,770
to compensate for my childhood trauma...

143
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,640
I, too, have childhood trauma.

144
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,020
The Lasso of Truth...

145
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,770
...never gets old.

146
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,650
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away.

147
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,280
Yes, if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

148
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,780
I know sex exists.

149
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,030
I've just never experienced it.

150
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,030
Damn it.

151
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Well...

152
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,790
I have to run.

153
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,830
Yeah.

154
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,660
Always a pleasure.

155
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,790
The sex thing was a metaphor...

156
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,170
for gothic literature.

157
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,630
There was just no way to recover from that.

158
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,670
Just let it go.

159
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,890
Well, I'd really love to stay and clean up more mess...

160
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,010
but this little superhero needs his breakfast.

161
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
Goodbye, Flash.

162
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,140
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

163
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,560
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

164
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,940
Will you be home for breakfast, sir?

165
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,030
Yes, I think so.

166
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,570
...the road to destruction.

167
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,530
This was never about her.

168
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,030
This is about you.

169
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,660
You have to stop living in the past.

170
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,290
Now, was that fast enough for you?

171
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,510
Ah, look who's here.

172
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,010
Shut up, Albert.

173
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,890
Every day.

174
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,520
I don't know how you do it, Barry.

175
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,930
What'd you, like, crawl here, bro?

176
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,810
Is he mad?

177
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,940
Well, you're getting fired.

178
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,890
You're getting murdered.

179
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,770
Oh, no, no, no.

180
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Let me guess.

181
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,020
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

182
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,940
-No-- -Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

183
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,900
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

184
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,530
Your keys' grandmother died,

185
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,820
and they need a personal day.

186
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,030
It was none of those things.

187
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,160
What was it this time, Barry?

188
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,160
It was, um, something else

189
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,950
that was far less outlandish.

190
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,910
And I know I missed the meeting...

191
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,290
but I'd still really like to present these case files for potential review.

192
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,670
I think we rushed these cases.

193
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,300
-We need to reopen them. -Oh! Rushed?

194
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,050
We got a backlog six months deep,

195
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,510
and you want us to move slower?

196
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,550
You need to focus your motion.

197
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,140
Do the work, close the case, move on.

198
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,060
You have a lot of potential, Barry.

199
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,020
You shouldn't still be getting me coffee after all these years.

200
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,690
You're right. That's... That's true.

201
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,270
Go get me a coffee.

202
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,650
Two sugars? Yeah.

203
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,690
Oh, yeah.

204
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
You're gonna love this.

205
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,670
I'm very satisfied with the ruling in the Johnson case.

206
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,380
The evidence our lab analyzed...

207
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,760
was more than sufficient to be conclusive.

208
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,260
-I'm still working that evidence. -Because of the diligence

209
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,640
and hard work and focus...

210
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,520
Barry was still working on that evidence.

211
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,890
Think if it were up to you

212
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,270
that we'd still be scraping Ted Bundy's molars.

213
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,940
You know what? I'm so happy you find this all so hilarious,

214
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,400
but we are dealing with real people's lives,

215
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,400
people's families.

216
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,570
And I don't think you can grasp the gravity of that.

217
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,280
So, why don't you leave me alone?

218
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,450
Barry Allen?

219
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,910
Iris West.

220
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
You...

221
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,540
know my full name also.

222
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,410
Yes, from school.

223
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,670
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us you had a friend from school.

224
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,710
We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.

225
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah, what does that make it now?

226
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,800
One?

227
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
One.

228
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,670
You guys are so...

229
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,680
Um, bye, you guys.

230
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,260
Okay. Oh, my God.

231
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,390
That was just... They're not really my friends. They're my work friends.

232
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,430
Do you work here?

233
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,020
Yes, I do.

234
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,560
God, it's been a long time, huh?

235
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,150
I feel like we saw each other...

236
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,070
like a few years ago, right?

237
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,780
No, because...

238
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,150
we haven't seen each other since...

239
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,450
college.

240
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,080
Maybe I was just thinking about you.

241
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,290
Well, I'm really glad I ran into you.

242
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,410
-Yeah. -Yeah.

243
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,540
Your father's appeal is tomorrow, right?

244
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,420
Yeah. How...

245
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,170
Sorry, how do you know about that?

246
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,880
I'm covering it for the paper.

247
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,760
How is he holding up?

248
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,760
Are you asking for the paper?

249
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,640
No, I'm asking as a friend.

250
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Although I'm sure the public would want to know as well.

251
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,520
Well...

252
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,520
my only official comment is that my dad is innocent.

253
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,570
Right.

254
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,150
I mean, no one...

255
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,280
would want to believe that their father killed their mother.

256
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,330
What do you mean, "believe"? My dad shouldn't be in jail.

257
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,530
My mom should be alive.

258
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,830
It's not about what I believe.

259
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
It's about what the truth is.

260
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,660
Right. No, yes, that's...

261
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,420
Oh, my God. That's what I meant.

262
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,210
Right.

263
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,790
Sorry, I have no official comment at this time.

264
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,400
You have a collect call

265
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,030
from the Iron Heights Penitentiary.

266
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,160
Do you wish to accept?

267
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Yes.

268
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Hey, Dad.

269
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,040
Hey, Barry.

270
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
How ya doing?

271
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm fine.

272
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,330
You getting out much?

273
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,410
Yeah.

274
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,330
Well, no.

275
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Uh, no.

276
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,170
But I, um, I ran into an old college friend...

277
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
Iris West, today.

278
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,050
Didn't you have a monster crush on her?

279
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,380
Well, she have a boyfriend?

280
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,930
Why don't you ask her out?

281
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,550
Dad, I, um...

282
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,520
I had a friend run the old security camera footage from the store...

283
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,640
through this new program he's developed.

284
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,940
And it's crystal clear now.

285
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
It's just...

286
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,900
you never look up, Dad.

287
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,320
You can't see your face.

288
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,070
So, without new evidence to support your alibi...

289
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,910
we're just gonna need to start thinking about the next appeal.

290
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,910
No, uh-uh.

291
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,540
You need to stop worrying about your old man.

292
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,710
Do that, you might actually have time for a girlfriend.

293
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,920
But Dad, I don't want...

294
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,420
We've done this before.

295
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,760
This was a last-ditch effort...

296
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,050
and we'll go through the motions tomorrow.

297
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,390
I'm okay, really.

298
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,930
You know, sometimes I even think

299
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,430
it's probably easier for me to be in here

300
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
than out there...

301
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
without her.

302
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,190
'Cause this way, I can imagine she's alive...

303
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,520
out there living her life.

304
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Barry?

305
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Barry?

306
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
You there?

307
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,780
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

308
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,790
Hey, remember that sauce she'd make on Sundays?

309
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,830
The whole house would smell like basil, tomatoes.

310
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,340
And she'd put on my sweats and start singing.

311
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,260
Yeah, what was that song?

312
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,800
I loved that song.

313
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,640
Remember that part.

314
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,770
It's not fair.

315
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,440
What's not fair, Monkey?

316
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,900
This question is stupid.

317
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,030
How many calculations can you think of with an answer of 24?

318
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,690
There are a bajillion answers.

319
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,950
How am I supposed to fit them all?

320
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,900
You are right.

321
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,530
There are a bajillion answers to this question.

322
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,910
Not every problem has a solution.

323
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,910
Sometimes you just have to let go.

324
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,160
Give your brain a rest and help me make the pasta.

325
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,210
Come on.

326
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,090
No.

327
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,920
Henry?

328
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,130
I need you to do me a favor.

329
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,420
I don't do favors.

330
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,300
Okay.

331
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,300
Barry needs you to do him a favor.

332
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,140
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

333
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,890
I need another can of tomatoes.

334
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,930
You have a can of tomatoes.

335
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,140
I need another one.

336
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,150
I thought you guys went to the store this morning.

337
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,310
But I forgot the tomatoes.

338
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
This looks way more fun.

339
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
Let's just let Barry go to the store.

340
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,780
You drive, right, Squirm?

341
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,200
-What? No. -Getting so big.

342
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,160
You can do anything. Look at ya.

343
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,530
You're getting gray, actually.

344
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,450
Green can, not the blue one, okay?

345
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,330
Got it.

346
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,160
Blue can, not the green one, right?

347
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,040
No!

348
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,040
Green can, not the blue one. What?

349
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,290
Oh, God.

350
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,670
She's gonna start singing.

351
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,010
Run!

352
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,880
Run, Barry!

353
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I love you, Monkey.

354
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,070
I love you more.

355
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,780
I loved you first.

356
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Nora?

357
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,430
Barry!

358
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Barry!

359
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,810
Barry!

360
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,150
Call 911 now!

361
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
Barry?

362
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,790
Barry?

363
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,580
Don't worry about tomorrow.

364
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,210
We always knew it was a long shot...

365
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,830
Dad?

366
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,130
Your call with Iron Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.

367
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,160
Barry Allen?

368
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,410
...evidence our lab...

369
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,700
You need to focus your motion.

370
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,210
Do the work...

371
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,300
Now, was that fast enough for you?

372
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,180
So, you're saying you went back in time?

373
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,390
Like in Pozharnov?

374
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,180
Yeah, like in Pozharnov, except, but Pozharnov was a second.

375
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,760
This time I went back a whole day.

376
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,930
So, let's imagine...

377
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,810
that it is, in fact, possible for you to run...

378
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,650
faster than the speed of light...

379
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,020
and in so doing, travel back in time.

380
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,030
It still would be...

381
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,900
wildly irresponsible.

382
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
I knew you were gonna say this.

383
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,820
Yes,

384
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,030
because, Barry, if you were to go into the past,

385
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,910
any interaction you have with your parents or yourself,

386
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,410
you step on the wrong blade of grass,

387
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,160
you have no idea what the consequences to that could be.

388
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,080
No, I know. The butterfly effect, right?

389
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,960
Yes.

390
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,830
I get it.

391
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
But Bruce... I could fix things.

392
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,210
You could also destroy everything.

393
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I could save her.

394
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,180
I could save both of them. I...

395
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,760
I could save your parents.

396
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,060
Barry, these scars we have...

397
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,940
make us who we are.

398
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,900
We're not meant to go back and fix them.

399
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,690
And there's nothing broken with you that needs to be fixed.

400
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,410
Take it from an old guy who's made a lot of mistakes.

401
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,530
Don't live your past.

402
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,040
Live your life.

403
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,910
Don't let your tragedy define you.

404
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,790
What if it's supposed to define me?

405
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,540
Your tragedy made you a hero.

406
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,170
And also made me alone.

407
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,390
We could hang out.

408
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,390
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

409
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,430
Like, I'm still hungry.

410
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,180
Not this time.

411
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,020
Maybe some other time.

412
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Yeah.

413
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,660
Nice ride.

414
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,160
You have fancy friends.

415
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah, it was an Uber.

416
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Exec.

417
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,540
Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the case at all.

418
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,170
I'm not here as a reporter.

419
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,800
Can we talk?

420
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,510
Come on in.

421
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,900
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot tidier in here than I expected.

422
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,770
Yeah?

423
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,650
Yeah, well, um...

424
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,570
Yeah. I'm a pretty tidy person.

425
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,700
Can I offer you a drink?

426
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,580
Sure.

427
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
I'll take a beer.

428
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,510
Beers, beers, beers.

429
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,010
I keep 'em in my fridge.

430
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,390
Thanks.

431
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Sure.

432
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,640
Look, I feel really bad

433
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,150
about earlier.

434
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,150
I should've been more sensitive.

435
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,530
And, um, I probably could've been less sensitive.

436
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,330
I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through.

437
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,410
It's like you lost both parents in one day.

438
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
I did.

439
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,170
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

440
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,090
and I lost my dad to the failures of the justice system.

441
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,800
Is that why you got into criminal forensics?

442
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,880
To try and fix the system?

443
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,890
Yeah.

444
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah, to fix it.

445
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,270
There's gotta be a way to fix it, right?

446
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,140
I mean, that's kinda why I got into journalism, too.

447
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,150
I could make it right if I could just go back somehow

448
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,530
and warn them without them knowing that I'd warned them.

449
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,400
I... thinking like that's gonna...

450
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,200
...drive you crazy.

451
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,320
"If I could just go back in time...

452
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,530
and stop the guy who did it." It's...

453
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,030
No, I can't do that, 'cause that's way too much interaction.

454
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,210
My dad wasn't even at home.

455
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,710
My mom sent him to go get a can of tomatoes.

456
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,210
I think whoever broke into the house thought it was empty.

457
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,300
And then my mom was in there with the knife in her hand

458
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,880
and things went bad, just this absurd chain of events.

459
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,430
And it's like, this footage should've finally supported my dad's alibi.

460
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,510
But instead...

461
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,680
three lives ruined for a can of tomatoes.

462
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,650
Oh, my God.

463
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
What?

464
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,780
Well, that could be it.

465
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,820
If my mom doesn't forget the tomatoes in the first place,

466
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,160
then he never leaves and she never dies.

467
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,780
No one would even have to see me.

468
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,580
Bruce said no interaction. This is no interaction.

469
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,950
This is just quick in, quick out,

470
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,580
back to the present, like I was never even there.

471
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,460
That's how I fix it. Oh, my God, Iris.

472
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,040
Thank you, so much.

473
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,460
This has been great.

474
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,210
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,920
I... I have to leave.

476
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,510
Okay. Right.

477
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,060
I had a really great time, by the way. We should do this again.

478
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,660
Kal-El, son of Krypton.

479
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,780
This is a bad idea.

480
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,580
This is a bad idea.

481
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,410
This is a bad idea.

482
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,040
So, you're fast.

483
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,710
Your dad's a murderer.

484
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Your dad's a murderer.

485
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,010
Call 911 now!

486
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,140
...now!

487
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,890
...now!

488
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,770
...now!

489
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,150
Hi, Mom.

490
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,540
Don't forget the tomatoes.

491
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,050
See you soon.

492
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,390
Please work.

493
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,820
? Happy Birthday, dear... ?

494
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,570
Happy Birthday, Barry.

495
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,290
- Go, Barry, hurry up. - Go!

496
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,670
Congratulations to the class of 2013!

497
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,170
I love you so much.

498
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,650
Monkey!

499
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,660
What are you wearing?

500
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,030
Is that Barry? And he's early?

501
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,830
What universe is this?

502
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,410
You've cut your hair.

503
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,540
Now you can see your eyes.

504
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,540
You look terrible.

505
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,420
Henry!

506
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,170
-You look old. -You look beautiful, baby.

507
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,670
What are they doing to you over there?

508
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,170
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

509
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,760
Come here.

510
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,640
I love you so much.

511
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,140
I love you, too.

512
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
I love you more.

513
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,560
I loved you first.

514
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,900
Go take a shower and change.

515
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,400
You smell like a boot.

516
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Go, go, go.

517
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,780
"Old,"

518
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
seriously?

519
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,530
Well, no, I mean like mature.

520
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,450
He's at that age, he wants to look old.

521
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,530
He, you know, gets into bars that way.

522
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,330
How can I help?

523
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,290
Hey, Mom, how was your day?

524
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
How was your month, or your last 18 years?

525
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,340
Or that's a weird question...

526
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,420
'cause I was here.

527
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,510
But obviously, we share those memories together.

528
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,390
Or I don't know, maybe we could make some new memories.

529
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,050
Like we could go to the aquarium, or the circus,

530
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
or to the park and you could push me on a swing.

531
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,140
That's also weird because I'm an adult now,

532
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,190
so I'd probably motivate my own motion on a swing.

533
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,310
So, how was it this week? How's school?

534
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,150
At school was... is good.

535
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,530
School's been great.

536
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,070
I've just been working really hard there on my...

537
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,320
studies.

538
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,160
Did you ask out that girl from econ?

539
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,790
I know freshman year is about

540
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,160
going out, meeting people, okay?

541
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,790
Exploring things.

542
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,790
Experimenting.

543
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,670
But you have to be very careful.

544
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,210
Oh, shit.

545
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,680
I... have to shit.

546
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,050
Outside.

547
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,560
Help!

548
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,270
Why are you here?

549
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,690
What year is it?

550
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,030
-No, no, no. -Help!

551
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,030
That's my face.

552
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,910
You stole my face.

553
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,700
Think I'm having a mushroom flashback?

554
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,660
Is that a thing?

555
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,910
How old are you?

556
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,460
Eighteen.

557
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,010
This is mad trippy.

558
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,510
So, we're, like, in the future.

559
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,390
No, wait.

560
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,310
This is not trippy, dude.

561
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,520
This is catastrophic.

562
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,770
And no, we're not in the future.

563
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,650
I was supposed to be back in the present,

564
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,690
but I'm still in the past.

565
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,400
And there's not supposed to be two of me.

566
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,280
You and I are not supposed to be occupying the same reality at all,

567
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,400
let alone interacting.

568
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,320
I just can't believe I'm a superhero who time travels--

569
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,200
No, no, no. You are not anything.

570
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,080
Which is good.

571
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,950
You don't want to be a superhero. It's scary.

572
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,660
And I get bug splatter in my teeth all the time.

573
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,910
Awesome.

574
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,460
Hey, do the thing again.

575
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,710
No, we don't have time.

576
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,300
Mom!

577
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,170
What are you doing? You're gonna tattle now?

578
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,630
Do the thing.

579
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Fine.

580
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,430
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,310
Happy?

582
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,140
Now undo it.

583
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,160
Ow.

584
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,420
Barry, are you okay up there?

585
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,790
We're fine!

586
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,830
I'm fine! Okay, Monkey.

587
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,920
So, do you have like a plane that goes underwater?

588
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,510
Or like a boat that can fly?

589
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
How old are you, like 40?

590
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Okay, you don't stop talking.

591
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,140
It's not charming.

592
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,930
It's abrasive and exhausting.

593
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,890
And, oh, my God.

594
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,890
I am starting to realize what people mean.

595
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,930
Just...

596
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,390
do me a favor

597
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,320
and promise me that meeting me isn't gonna screw up space-time.

598
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Broski...

599
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
I got you.

600
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,280
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

601
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
What do you mean?

602
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
What do I do?

603
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
I could drug you.

604
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,410
Yeah, I could drug you,

605
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,040
and then you'd pass out, you'd wake up

606
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,330
and you'd forget that anything ever happened.

607
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,920
And it wouldn't be wrong, right? Because you're me.

608
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,790
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

609
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,710
Please don't...

610
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,590
drug me.

611
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,460
No.

612
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,210
No. Because here's the thing, and I thought about it before.

613
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
I don't want to be drugged.

614
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
But I'm sure we can think of another way.

615
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,430
Let's put on our Barry thinking caps

616
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,300
and think of a different solution

617
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,760
for memory loss.

618
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,310
Also, I'm a green belt... in the capoeira,

619
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,520
and I have extensively studied wrestler,

620
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,150
and I could just go frickin' lunatic on you.

621
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,570
Besides, I have a date tonight...

622
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Okay.

623
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,410
How hard do you have to hit someone to make them forget stuff?

624
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,910
If I hit you in the past, will it hurt me in the future?

625
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,160
Wait. You say you have a date tonight?

626
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,700
Yeah. Wait, what were you doing?

627
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,580
Uh, nothing.

628
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,710
Who's your date with?

629
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,670
This super babe in my econ class.

630
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,710
Iris West?

631
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,960
Oh, my God!

632
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,050
Do we marry her?

633
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,710
You're going on a date with her tonight?

634
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,760
That's why I need Mom to do my laundry.

635
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,380
You don't even do your own laundry?

636
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,510
Do you?

637
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,050
Okay.

638
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,810
I'm actually gonna go.

639
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,680
What do you mean?

640
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,520
Enjoy your life. Do you.

641
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,020
Change literally nothing.

642
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,390
Um, I'll see you again never.

643
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,150
I have a few more questions, though.

644
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,270
We have so much to learn from each other.

645
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,530
Oh, great.

646
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,530
Well, you're leaving me.

647
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,900
And now the storm's gonna ruin my date.

648
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,030
What day is it today?

649
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,790
Sunday?

650
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
No, the date.

651
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,540
It's September 29th.

652
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Shit.

653
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,460
This storm, this is the day.

654
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,090
What day?

655
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,510
The day I got my powers.

656
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,890
The day you get your powers.

657
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,640
Powers?

658
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,510
Listen...

659
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,390
I can't tell you why I traveled back in time,

660
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,770
and I can't tell you what I changed.

661
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,390
But, essentially, in my version of reality,

662
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,810
I ended up interning at the Central City Crime Lab in my freshman year,

663
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
and that's where it happened.

664
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,650
Well, happens.

665
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,030
Tonight, September 29,

666
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,900
the accident that gives me my powers.

667
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,530
And if you're not there...

668
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,820
in 30 minutes...

669
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,700
then you won't get the powers.

670
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,540
Which means I don't get the powers, maybe?

671
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,540
And then, that would mean that I lose my way

672
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,290
of getting back in time in the first place,

673
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,960
and then I literally have no idea what happens.

674
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,670
Powers?

675
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,050
Wait, but what about our date tonight?

676
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,760
She might be our future wife.

677
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,560
There might not be a future...

678
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,640
if you don't come with me...

679
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,020
right now.

680
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Eight minutes.

681
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,450
How are we gonna to get inside?

682
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,530
What are you doing?

683
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,700
Would you stop whining?

684
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,410
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

685
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,390
We walk through the door.

686
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,690
Yes, it's okay. It's called phasing.

687
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,770
Come on.

688
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,820
I love phasing.

689
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,200
Everybody moves.

690
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,770
Well...

691
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,140
this is it.

692
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,150
This is where I was sitting.

693
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,440
And actually, let me take this for you.

694
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Thank you.

695
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,400
Okay, I had just opened those windows...

696
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,950
to clear out the fumes.

697
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,910
Right around now.

698
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,950
And I was sitting in that chair,

699
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,910
and I was right under this shelf of chemicals.

700
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,660
And that's when the lightning hits.

701
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,660
Wait.

702
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,040
I get hit by lightning?

703
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
No, no, no.

704
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,920
You don't get hit by lightning.

705
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,420
Okay, 'cause for a second I thought you said...

706
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,920
The lightning hits the chemicals...

707
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,460
which then you get bathed in,

708
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,590
and that's what electrocutes you.

709
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,510
Okay, but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.

710
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,380
Sit down.

711
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,300
-No, you sit down. -I already have the powers!

712
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,510
You already have the powers!

713
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,390
Exactly!

714
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,930
I am not getting struck by lightning!

715
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
It worked.

716
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,320
It looks like you lost a tooth.

717
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,570
No?

718
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,070
You lost a tooth.

719
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,670
All right. We gotta go.

720
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,300
What have we got?

721
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,430
The alarms in the sterile lab.

722
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Go check it.

723
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,640
Securing the entrance.

724
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
We've gotta phase.

725
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,900
Phase, phasing.

726
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,030
Shit!

727
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,660
I'm slow.

728
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,210
Why is your place so much nicer than I expected it to be?

729
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,510
You like it? Mom had to help decorate.

730
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,010
You know Mom.

731
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,390
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

732
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,010
Classic Mom.

733
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,900
What a day.

734
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,270
Barry, the accident gave you powers,

735
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,820
but took mine away.

736
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,570
So, I don't know how I get back.

737
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,280
Without access to the Speed Force,

738
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,950
I don't know how I ever leave.

739
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,660
Do you understand what I'm saying?

740
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,450
I might be stuck.

741
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
Wait.

742
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,410
I have powers now?

743
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,670
Yeah, but...

744
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,920
you... No, no, no.

745
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,140
Holy speedballs.

746
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,560
Okay, I know this is incredibly exciting,

747
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,020
because I went through it. Speedy Gonzales!

748
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,400
Yes, I've done it many times myself.

749
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,900
You can't just start...

750
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
Shit.

751
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,700
? We are young,

752
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,450
we run green ?

753
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,950
? Keep our teeth

754
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,530
Nice and clean ?

755
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,290
? See our friends

756
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,790
See the sights ?

757
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,790
? And feel all right ?

758
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,790
? Got some cash

759
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,340
Bought some wheels ?

760
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,050
? Took it out

761
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,670
'Cross the fields ?

762
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,260
? Lost control,

763
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,760
hit a wall ?

764
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,760
? But we're all right ?

765
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,190
Oh, my...

766
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,520
Okay, I'm leaving!

767
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,900
Put your hands up.

768
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
What did you do?

769
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Nothing.

770
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,170
Why?

771
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,140
Barry...

772
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,770
I could've told you about the clothes.

773
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,640
It's friction.

774
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,020
You run too fast, and regular fabrics are gonna burn up.

775
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,560
It's the same reason why you can't

776
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,020
move people very far at hyperspeed.

777
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,650
That broccoli looks rotten.

778
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,280
Look, some things you can move.

779
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,650
Like, you can move,

780
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,900
for instance, a microwave.

781
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,700
But you can't move something like, say...

782
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,570
a baby.

783
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,910
Barry, it's like I've never eaten anything before.

784
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,660
Everything has this vivid flavor. Try a little.

785
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,790
Just take a little bite.

786
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,670
That's bad, isn't it?

787
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,670
Yeah, this is not good.

788
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,670
No, I was kidding.

789
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,670
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

790
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,550
I'm so hungry.

791
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,670
Hey, wait.

792
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,180
I wanna try that phasing thing.

793
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,260
How do I do that?

794
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,760
You don't. Not yet. Okay?

795
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,010
It's very complicated.

796
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,930
Takes a long time

797
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,520
to train your body to be able to speed up

798
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,390
whilst your molecules slow down enough to pass through

799
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,270
the molecular structure of solid objects...

800
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,400
Get out of here!

801
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,330
You've gotta start letting me finish my sentences.

802
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,410
Are we always this sleepy? And hungry

803
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,670
and naked?

804
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,460
Well, the first two, yes.

805
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,090
The third one, no. I've figured that part out.

806
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,670
And honestly, if we're gonna do this

807
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,050
there's a lot I'm gonna have to explain to you.

808
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,010
So, a good place to start, I guess, is that,

809
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,930
yeah, the original suit

810
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,390
- was actually made out of this polysynth...

811
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,430
Or we'll

812
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,890
pick this up tomorrow.

813
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,270
So, the suit is inside the ring?

814
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,150
Yeah.

815
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,520
What?

816
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,520
And I can have this?

817
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,070
No, you can't have it.

818
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,030
You can borrow it

819
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,320
so you don't kill yourself using your powers.

820
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
You're gonna push this button

821
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,530
and the silk molecules are gonna uncoil,

822
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,780
absorbing atmospheric gases

823
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,410
and expanding the suit to full size.

824
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,450
Ready?

825
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,390
It was so tiny...

826
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,520
You're supposed to put it on before it hits the floor.

827
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,560
What, like change... right here in front of you?

828
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,560
There's no one even here anyway, Barry.

829
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,650
Come on--

830
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,020
Whoo, man.

831
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,150
Tight.

832
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,150
It hurts.

833
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,570
You know where it hurts?

834
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,450
In my dick.

835
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,530
Okay. I know, I know,

836
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,950
but I don't need to know.

837
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,450
Sorry, can we move on?

838
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,290
Here's what I'm thinking.

839
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,580
If I can train you to move like I do,

840
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,210
then we can re-create the Chronobowl.

841
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,080
Chronobowl?

842
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,080
In the Speed Force.

843
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,340
Speed Force?

844
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,340
And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.

845
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,420
Back to the Future.

846
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,050
Yes! Eric Stoltz

847
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,510
is chur boy in that movie.

848
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,800
What an embodied performance.

849
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,140
You mean Michael J. Fox?

850
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Back to the Future?

851
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,680
- Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future? -  -Oh, my God!

852
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,560
-What's going on? -I don't know.

853
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,030
You need to take the suit off now.

854
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,450
Thank God.

855
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,290
...reported seeing a mysterious object

856
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,960
hovering above the Australian seaboard.

857
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,800
-We've obtained footage from the sighting and as you can see, the object... -Zod.

858
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,300
"Zod"?

859
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,880
What's a zod?

860
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,510
According to US government officials,

861
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,390
satellite data

862
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,270
has confirmed the presence of a spacecraft.

863
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,310
We'll be sure--

864
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
My name is General Zod.

865
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,820
I come from a world far from yours.

866
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,650
For some time, your world

867
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,200
-has sheltered one of my citizens. -No, no, no.

868
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,330
-This can't be happening. -I request that you return this individual...

869
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,080
- Not now. - ...to my custody.

870
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,790
What's happening?

871
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,330
Zod's looking for Superman.

872
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,960
What's a superman?

873
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Superman is an alien who lives on Earth.

874
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,050
I'm assuming still incognito.

875
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,640
But, yeah, he's an alien,

876
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,430
and he's very powerful,

877
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,060
and he's just the best.

878
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,270
And then Zod is an alien from the same planet,

879
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,520
also very powerful,

880
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,060
but he's just the worst.

881
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,770
And Zod came here to find Clark.

882
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,150
Wait, who's Clark?

883
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,900
Clark is Superman.

884
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,280
Oh. Okay.

885
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,650
But then Zod

886
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,660
also tried to terraform the planet with this World Engine thing,

887
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,160
and Superman stopped him eventually,

888
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,160
but not before Zod killed thousands of people.

889
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,330
-Yeesh. -And at the time,

890
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,920
there was nothing I could do, I've...

891
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,590
Wait, you...

892
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,420
You were there?

893
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,300
Yeah, I had just gotten my powers.

894
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,180
And I was still putting some finishing touches on my suit.

895
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,640
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

896
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,440
it started destroying Metropolis,

897
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,400
so I just went there

898
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,270
and I started trying to save people.

899
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
Daddy?

900
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,910
Listen to me! Run away!

901
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,410
Run away!

902
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,330
There was this kid, and I...

903
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,960
I got him, but then...

904
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,790
I couldn't get his dad.

905
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,670
Daddy!

906
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,770
It was all I could do, save that one kid.

907
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,650
Only Superman could stop Zod.

908
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,820
But not in time to save those people.

909
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,910
And now it's about to happen again.

910
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,530
But...

911
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,080
if I can find the entire Justice League,

912
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,330
Superman and the rest of the band...

913
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,540
Right.

914
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,300
...then maybe I can prevent the whole thing from ever even happening at all.

915
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,380
Um, give me your laptop.

916
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,430
Okay.

917
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,510
What is that smell?

918
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,510
Could be anything.

919
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Honestly.

920
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,520
Who's that?

921
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,020
That's Gary.

922
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,440
That's the smell. It's...

923
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,060
Don't worry. He's breezy.

924
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,900
We can do this.

925
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,770
Uh, let's see,

926
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,030
Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

927
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,660
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

928
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,160
Patty... is your roommate?

929
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,290
And that's her boyfriend, Albert.

930
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,660
What's up?

931
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,170
Good morning.

932
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,580
Oh, sorry.

933
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,210
And, uh, guys...

934
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,170
This is my cousin.

935
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Barry.

936
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,930
I'm starving.

937
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,430
Okay.

938
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,440
Victor Stone, Gotham City University.

939
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,940
Yes. Here he is.

940
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,520
Victor Stone, star quarterback for the Knight...

941
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,650
Shit, okay.

942
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,190
He's not Cyborg yet.

943
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,320
Wonder Woman.

944
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,700
Wonder Woman!

945
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,320
Las Vegas residency.

946
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,200
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

947
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,450
No. That is not Diana.

948
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,330
Aquaman.

949
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,330
Aquaman? Is that like

950
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,210
a super mermaid?

951
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,710
No, Albert, he's not a super mermaid.

952
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:13,590
Okay?

953
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,340
He's half Atlantean, half human

954
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,550
with superhuman strength

955
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,510
who can control marine life with his mind.

956
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,630
So, like a super mermaid?

957
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,010
No, Albert!

958
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,800
That is what you described.

959
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,560
We'll just try Arthur Curry...

960
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,140
Maine...

961
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,390
lighthouse.

962
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,560
Here we are.

963
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,400
Thomas Curry. That's his dad.

964
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Uh, phone.

965
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,280
Hello.

966
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,650
Hello, Thomas Curry?

967
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,530
Yes.

968
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,450
Could I speak to Arthur? Is Arthur around?

969
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,910
You wanna speak to my dog?

970
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:43,910
What?

971
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,030
No, no.

972
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,410
Um, sorry. Uh...

973
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,660
Is this Thomas Curry?

974
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,700
Yes.

975
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,710
And you work at a lighthouse?

976
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,580
Yes.

977
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,790
Okay, and your wife

978
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,040
is the queen of Atlantis?

979
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Uh, no.

980
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,010
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

981
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,050
um, a fishlike woman

982
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,930
washed into your life

983
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,640
at some point or another?

984
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,020
Very funny, asshole.

985
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,150
Arthur Curry was never born.

986
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,270
What?

987
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:14,900
This is a disaster. I-I-

988
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,190
I completely destroyed history.

989
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,320
Like Eric Stoltz.

990
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,190
Okay, why do you keep saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

991
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,650
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

992
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,530
What?

993
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,570
Time travel?

994
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,450
We talking "BTTF"?

995
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,530
Come on, who is this guy?

996
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,410
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

997
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,080
I've seen all of them

998
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,580
and Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly.

999
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
Really?

1000
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,420
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

1001
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,800
I can't explain that to you, Gary.

1002
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,090
That's not your thigh.

1003
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,130
It's the wrong actor, and it's upside down.

1004
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,380
Is it?

1005
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,890
The point is that

1006
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,520
in Back to the Future

1007
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Marty McFly is very famously played

1008
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,060
by Michael J. Fox.

1009
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,060
The guy from Footloose?

1010
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,650
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

1011
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:57,520
Bacon.

1012
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,440
Kevin Bacon's Maverick

1013
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,400
with the volleyball, the gay guys, and the planes?

1014
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,280
Top Gun.

1015
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,950
? Great balls of fire! ? Top Gun, right?

1016
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,280
No, no, no.

1017
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,910
I completely broke the universe.

1018
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,910
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

1019
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,790
Yes.

1020
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,910
Thank you.

1021
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,290
I created a world with no metahumans.

1022
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,460
And now there's no one to defend us from Zod.

1023
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Albert!

1024
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,300
There's no Cyborg.

1025
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,510
There's no Aquaman. There's no Wonder Woman.

1026
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,760
There's no Superman.

1027
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,010
There's no Batman.

1028
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,260
I'm Batman.

1029
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,020
What, you... What did you just say?

1030
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,190
I'm Batman.

1031
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,570
Batman exists?

1032
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,440
Hundo p.

1033
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,780
Yeah, dude. Nobody knows who he really is,

1034
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,280
but he exists.

1035
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
Right.

1036
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,200
Well, uh, we...

1037
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,160
my cousin Barry and I,

1038
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,540
have to go to that cousin's dinner.

1039
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Now.

1040
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:57,040
But it was a pleasure to meet you all.

1041
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,080
And Gary. Barry.

1042
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,170
Gary. Barry.

1043
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,170
-Barry. -Gary.

1044
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,050
Gary. Barry.

1045
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,170
Barry!

1046
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,530
What, are you frickin' kidding me with this place?

1047
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,780
What is this, hell?

1048
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,210
It's open.

1049
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,140
Look at all this cool shit!

1050
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,390
Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

1051
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Hello?

1052
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,020
Bruce?

1053
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,950
Bruce, are you there?

1054
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
Oh, boy.

1055
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,830
Hey, I didn't know you painted.

1056
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,660
They're good.

1057
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,710
Bruce Wayne?

1058
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,010
Bruce?

1059
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:44,900
Hey, check this out.

1060
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,150
There's, like, bells connected to every room in this house.

1061
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,530
Hey, maybe we can find this Bruce guy...

1062
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,450
if we just ring all these bells, right?

1063
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,780
You don't understand how servant bells work?

1064
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,450
You ring them from all the other places.

1065
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,330
What?

1066
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,540
You don't have, like, Downton Abbey in your universe?

1067
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,040
Downtown Abbey's?

1068
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,290
The chain of, like, family-style restaurants?

1069
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,420
They're like, it's like cheaper Bananabee's.

1070
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,300
Oh, you know what I'd really go for right now?

1071
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,720
Abbey's sizzlin' zucchini squares.

1072
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,890
Okay.

1073
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,040
You know what, man?

1074
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,580
I've had it with you.

1075
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,410
Who the hell are you?

1076
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,540
I'm the guy who lives here.

1077
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,460
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

1078
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
You hungry?

1079
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,170
...following the broadcast earlier from General Zod.

1080
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,340
The individual they're searching for is still at large.

1081
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,420
So...

1082
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,760
...you're the same person as him...

1083
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,270
but from an alternate timeline.

1084
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,310
Yes.

1085
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:43,770
In which...

1086
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,770
you and I are friends?

1087
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,020
Yeah, you're like

1088
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,190
probably my best friend.

1089
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,400
Okay.

1090
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,070
Well, but you're a bit... you're, uh...

1091
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,070
chronologically different.

1092
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,950
Older.

1093
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,910
That's what I can't understand.

1094
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,450
I traveled back in time from here to here.

1095
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,330
Yet somehow, everything's all changed

1096
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,540
back here.

1097
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,330
Or like when you were born, so...

1098
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,210
Well... time isn't linear. Right?

1099
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,550
Right.

1100
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,510
At some point

1101
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,640
you probably saw a movie that told you

1102
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,060
that if you went back and changed the past,

1103
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,390
you'd create a kind of a branched timeline, right?

1104
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,690
Like, look.

1105
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,900
New present

1106
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,780
and new future.

1107
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,650
Yeah.

1108
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,320
Well, time doesn't work like that.

1109
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,910
That's not how time works.

1110
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,530
When you go back and change the past

1111
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,780
you create a fulcrum.

1112
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,080
You put yourself on a whole nother strand of spaghetti.

1113
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,330
New future.

1114
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,710
New past.

1115
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,420
It's retrocausal.

1116
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,960
It goes both ways.

1117
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,670
Actually, it goes many ways.

1118
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,590
Maybe some other time.

1119
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,260
Okay, but in an ontological paradox model, there's not...

1120
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,260
What you did was you changed the future

1121
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,270
and you changed the past.

1122
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,940
If a person is stupid enough

1123
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,440
to mess with time...

1124
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,320
what you eventually end up with

1125
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,520
is this.

1126
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,280
The multiverse.

1127
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:20,160
Some strands run almost parallel.

1128
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,700
There will be inevitable intersections,

1129
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,790
and others that are just...

1130
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,540
wildly divergent.

1131
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
What it is...

1132
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:30,420
is a hot mess.

1133
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,040
It's a crapshoot.

1134
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,050
It's all just a crapshoot.

1135
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,170
What does the parmesan mean?

1136
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,170
The metaphor's over. It's just a garnish.

1137
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,300
And I'll tell ya something.

1138
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,390
A person would have to be an idiot

1139
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,140
to play craps

1140
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,270
with the space-time continuum.

1141
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,140
Yeah, an idiot.

1142
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,900
Here.

1143
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,150
Are you joking with the chewing noises right now?

1144
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
So, uh,

1145
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,280
you're the reason

1146
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,450
this Zod character

1147
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,950
is about to destroy the Earth?

1148
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,410
Maybe.

1149
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,540
There's a guy called Superman

1150
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,660
who can stop Zod?

1151
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,580
Yeah, yeah.

1152
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:11,830
And flies?

1153
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,670
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1154
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,540
Yes, he flies,

1155
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,090
and he shoots lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1156
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,840
No one said "Superman"...

1157
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,760
that might be a little on the nose?

1158
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,930
You call yourself Batman.

1159
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,510
Yeah. I don't call myself

1160
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,640
Super Batman.

1161
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,770
Wait, he's Batman?

1162
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,640
What did you think we were doing here?

1163
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,150
I thought this was the cousin's dinner.

1164
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,440
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1165
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,400
Not really. Not so much anymore.

1166
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,150
You know...

1167
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,650
they don't really need me.

1168
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,820
Things have changed.

1169
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:47,790
Gotham's now one of the safest cities in the world.

1170
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,540
Well, I... I need you.

1171
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,460
We need you.

1172
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,540
In my timeline,

1173
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,790
Batman's our strategist, our leader.

1174
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,170
The world needs Superman.

1175
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,460
You're the best detective in the world.

1176
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,550
You're probably the only person who can help me find him.

1177
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,300
So, will you help us?

1178
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,590
Pass.

1179
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,520
Like pass the salt?

1180
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,140
Bruce?

1181
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,520
He doesn't want to help us...

1182
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,440
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1183
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Bat shit?

1184
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah, his bat stuff, his bat things.

1185
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,650
Stand on that thing.

1186
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
Okay, remember when you phased through the floor?

1187
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,700
Yeah.

1188
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,700
So, I need you to do that again.

1189
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,300
What is this place?

1190
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,410
Dude!

1191
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,790
This place straight beeves!

1192
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:54,830
"Beeves"?

1193
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,170
Barry!

1194
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,550
I almost died

1195
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,640
in an abyss!

1196
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,010
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1197
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,140
Is this what I think it is?

1198
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,780
Holy shit!

1199
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,070
I used to see

1200
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,200
this thing on the news when I was a kid!

1201
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Okay, well...

1202
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,790
refine search.

1203
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,080
Date of birth.

1204
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,460
Wasn't born. He arrived.

1205
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,540
Oh, Barry, look!

1206
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:41,710
I'm busy.

1207
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,960
With what?

1208
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,090
Looking for unidentified objects entering Earth's atmosphere

1209
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,970
anywhere near Kansas in the last 50 years.

1210
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,800
He has a back door into NASA.

1211
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,560
'Course he does.

1212
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
Yeah, but Barry,

1213
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,140
check this out.

1214
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,060
This bag laughs.

1215
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,690
Okay, can't you take anything seriously?

1216
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,270
Stop messing around.

1217
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,020
Dude, come on.

1218
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,440
Have you seen this place?

1219
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,780
It's amazing!

1220
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,820
Hello!

1221
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,910
Has the gravity of this not sunk in for you?

1222
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,410
Stop messing around, Barry.

1223
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,790
I won't say it again.

1224
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,080
Yeesh.

1225
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,660
Sorry, Mom.

1226
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,710
Shut up.

1227
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,790
Shut up.

1228
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,790
You have no idea how lucky you are.

1229
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,040
No idea!

1230
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,550
You take everything for granted.

1231
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,090
You don't even appreciate...

1232
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:28,670
You just walk around thinking

1233
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,510
that you're so funny and so cool.

1234
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,890
And it's embarrassing,

1235
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,010
because

1236
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,310
you're not any of those things!

1237
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,270
Hey, screw you, man!

1238
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,690
I've done nothing but everything you've asked.

1239
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,400
You made me get struck by lightning!

1240
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,940
I phased naked through the floor.

1241
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,520
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

1242
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,270
Now I'm probably gonna have to move.

1243
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,440
You won't even tell me why you're here.

1244
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,940
But will you at least tell me why

1245
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,660
you're being so mean to me... for no reason?

1246
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,160
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1247
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:58,330
Wait, what?

1248
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,160
Forget it.

1249
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:03,920
The monkey? Wait...

1250
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,960
So, you're mad at me

1251
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,800
for playing with a toy?

1252
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,090
It's not a toy.

1253
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,300
Mom bought us that monkey.

1254
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,890
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1255
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,140
She gives us monkey stuff all the time.

1256
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,890
Right.

1257
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,890
Look...

1258
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:21,890
I'm sorry.

1259
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,690
I'm not very good with people.

1260
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
Even myself.

1261
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,570
Come on, dude.

1262
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,030
You're... You're not that bad.

1263
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,570
You can just be kind of a dick sometimes.

1264
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
But let's face it. I am pretty obnoxious.

1265
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,410
But I just get excited.

1266
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,790
Come on. This place is pretty cool, right?

1267
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:45,290
Yeah.

1268
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,840
All right, well, um...

1269
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:52,670
I'll let you work.

1270
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,900
I know you're there.

1271
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,160
You know what I'm stuck on?

1272
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,910
That thing you said, with the spaghetti.

1273
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,700
You said there were certain intersections

1274
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,290
that would always be inevitable.

1275
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,580
You had an Alfred.

1276
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,290
My Bruce has an Alfred.

1277
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,670
Different worlds, different times...

1278
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
yet there it is.

1279
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,840
Certain people,

1280
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,180
certain events,

1281
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,890
certain strands of spaghetti,

1282
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,640
drawn to each other like... like magnets.

1283
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,890
I've read all about

1284
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,400
temporal paradoxes and causal loops. But

1285
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,900
this is more than that.

1286
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,940
Inevitable intersections

1287
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,650
are something none of the theories could have anticipated 'cause,

1288
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,780
well, how do you explain that except for...

1289
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,530
fate?

1290
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,660
If you are listening,

1291
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,660
sorry about your parents.

1292
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,920
I'm just trying to save mine.

1293
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,290
There has to be a way.

1294
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,170
There is a way, Barry.

1295
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,590
Just keep trying. Keep trying, Barry.

1296
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
Found him.

1297
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,890
Barry, wake up.

1298
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,430
Clark's being held by a mercenary group

1299
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,060
in a Siberian black site.

1300
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,640
Get up, Barry.

1301
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,890
The goat's on fire.

1302
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:10,900
We're going to Russia.

1303
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:13,940
Sweet.

1304
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,150
Mm. Coffee.

1305
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,700
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1306
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,150
I'll help you get this Superman.

1307
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,160
Then, you're on your own.

1308
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
Oh!

1309
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,330
You're...

1310
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,410
You are, you're...

1311
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,790
Yeah.

1312
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,960
I'm Batman.

1313
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,680
So, what's the plan?

1314
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,640
We're just gonna, what, grab Superman

1315
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,140
and dip set before the block is hot?

1316
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,180
I don't know.

1317
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,690
Hey, you should ask him.

1318
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:15,690
You ask him.

1319
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,560
You should ask him.

1320
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,440
Yeah,

1321
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,310
I'm not gonna ask him.

1322
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,900
Why not? I thought Batman was supposed to be your friend.

1323
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,690
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1324
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,570
We're here.

1325
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:24,570
Activating hover mode.

1326
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,830
Ejector seat on.

1327
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,910
Ejector seat.

1328
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:33,200
Ejector seat.

1329
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:39,290
Okay, there are stages.

1330
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,050
You're strapped to your parachutes.

1331
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,890
Hey, where's yours?

1332
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,150
This rips dicks!

1333
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,790
All clear. Let's move.

1334
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,140
Okay!

1335
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:49,030
Good. Everybody's fast now but me.

1336
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,570
Why is it so cold? - It's the Arctic, Barry.

1337
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:55,660
Where'd he go?

1338
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,410
I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1339
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,340
Superman would be down there for sure.

1340
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,420
Yeah. Okay.

1341
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,200
What did you do?

1342
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,540
I had to move you. But

1343
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,660
I just did it a little.

1344
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,840
This might hurt.

1345
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,890
Just let it out.

1346
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,760
Let's go.

1347
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,190
That's where you keep Superman.

1348
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,070
Like a big scrotum.

1349
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,790
He's gonna hack the Soviet security cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1350
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,920
I tried all the combinations.

1351
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,920
Yes!

1352
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,260
Shit.

1353
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,390
Kal-El?

1354
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,270
It's not him.

1355
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,430
We've gotta go.

1356
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,520
Wait.

1357
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,310
We can't just leave her here. Look at her.

1358
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,570
I'll grab her. Just go!

1359
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,660
I got you.

1360
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,050
I'll handle this jabroni.

1361
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,770
What the...

1362
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,150
Barry!

1363
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,320
Somebody shot me!

1364
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,700
Time to dip set!

1365
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,800
You, you lead the way!

1366
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,550
-Go! -Not that way! Not that way!

1367
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,520
Oh, God!

1368
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:13,150
Cover!

1369
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,290
It's coming around.

1370
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,210
Hurry, hurry.

1371
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,840
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1372
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,810
No!

1373
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,020
Come on.

1374
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,900
Let's go.

1375
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,400
You didn't tell me we could get shot!

1376
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,650
Why would you assume we couldn't?

1377
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:15,920
Oh, great! To die at the feet of a Sputnik.

1378
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,670
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1379
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,930
Stay calm. It'll heal.

1380
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,800
Come on.

1381
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,570
How much do you weigh?

1382
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,900
180. Each. Plus her, 440.

1383
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,700
Hold on.

1384
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,520
Oh, great. They're here. They're over here, too.

1385
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,190
Smirnoff Ice. Yes. Smirnoff Ice.

1386
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,280
Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1387
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,320
Yeah, okay.

1388
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,450
What's the play?

1389
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,160
Batman, what do we do? What now?

1390
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,410
Now...

1391
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,790
we try not to die.

1392
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,190
Oh, you guys should've seen that in slo-mo.

1393
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,560
Yeah, I'm just realizing that I didn't really think this through.

1394
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,690
There are good Kryptonians...

1395
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,810
and then there are very, very bad Kryptonians.

1396
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,280
And I was very confident that we were just gonna find Superman,

1397
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,190
and if we found Superman,

1398
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,070
then this would all be super simple.

1399
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,820
- Who are you? - Holy Funyuns.

1400
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:36,830
Hi.

1401
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,910
-I... I'm Barry. -We're Barry.

1402
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,920
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1403
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,830
But we found you instead.

1404
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,170
What do you want with Kal-El?

1405
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,050
We were trying to rescue him.

1406
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:48,090
Why?

1407
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,920
Because he's my friend.

1408
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,970
Do you... Do you know him?

1409
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,890
She looks mad. Get ready.

1410
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:57,640
She might do laser vision, or she might do, like, a freezy breath...

1411
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,430
or she'll just start throwing crazy...

1412
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,680
My name is Kara.

1413
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:02,640
Daughter of Zor-El.

1414
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:04,770
Kal-El was my cousin.

1415
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,520
Right, and who's Kal-El again?

1416
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,400
It's Superman.

1417
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,030
No, 'cause you said that was Clark.

1418
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,150
Who's Clark?

1419
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,530
Clark is his human name.

1420
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,410
Clark.

1421
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,290
He was an infant when we left.

1422
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:22,580
The last son of Krypton... I...

1423
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,920
I was sent to protect him.

1424
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:29,210
It looks like he never made it to Earth in this universe.

1425
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,220
Our pods, they must have separated.

1426
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,050
Wait, so you thought a baby

1427
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,510
was gonna protect us from this Zod guy?

1428
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,140
General Zod is here.

1429
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,010
He must have tracked my pod's signal.

1430
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:41,560
I have to go.

1431
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,770
Whoa, whoa, wait.

1432
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,560
Well, you need to recover your strength.

1433
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,020
Actually, Barry...

1434
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,690
take her to the roof

1435
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,520
and put her in the sun.

1436
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900
Yeah.

1437
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:52,900
-Yeah. -Whatever, like if, I mean,

1438
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,650
you're solar powered.

1439
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,280
Good for you. I've been trying to...

1440
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,540
We'll take that with us.

1441
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,710
Um, am I cool to...

1442
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,300
turn around?

1443
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,140
Are you dressed

1444
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,260
in a red cape?

1445
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,520
You're levitating?

1446
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,530
Is it always this loud?

1447
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,950
Is it loud?

1448
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,410
Are you, uh, good? Do you feel, um...

1449
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,910
strong yet, or...

1450
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:54,090
Yep, that seems, uh,

1451
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,090
seems strong. You know...

1452
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,430
old man Barry, down there,

1453
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,890
says if we don't stop Captain Zode,

1454
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,140
he'll kill thousands of people.

1455
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,640
Billions of people.

1456
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,140
Billions?

1457
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,640
Of your people.

1458
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:08,520
They're good people.

1459
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,690
Good people?

1460
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,400
We came to this planet

1461
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,570
looking for a safe place to live,

1462
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,280
and they put me in a cage.

1463
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,200
Yeah. A lot of humans are dicks.

1464
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,910
But then

1465
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,540
there's babies and ballerinas.

1466
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,040
And entertainment wrestlers.

1467
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,540
A lot of humans are worth saving.

1468
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,920
Maybe to you.

1469
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,540
But I'm not a human.

1470
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,300
I'm a Kryptonian.

1471
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,090
She's gone.

1472
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,640
I have to get my powers back.

1473
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,640
If I can re-create the accident that gave me my powers...

1474
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,440
maybe I can reconnect to the Speed Force...

1475
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,900
and maybe we'd stand a chance against Zod.

1476
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,020
Or kill yourself in the process.

1477
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,200
Tell me something.

1478
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,450
If you get your powers back,

1479
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:04,080
you can go anywhere.

1480
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:07,290
You can go to another timeline, another universe.

1481
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,660
Why do you wanna stay...

1482
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,040
and fight to save this one?

1483
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,170
Because this is the world where my mom lives.

1484
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,420
I went back in time to save her.

1485
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,800
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1486
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,680
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1487
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,180
How do you tell someone something like that?

1488
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,560
I lost my parents... but

1489
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,770
that pain...

1490
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:42,160
made me who I am.

1491
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,030
I'm not sure I know who I am without it, actually.

1492
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,790
I spent a lifetime...

1493
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,960
trying to right the wrongs of the past.

1494
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,090
As if

1495
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:00,220
putting on a cape and fighting crime

1496
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,180
would bring my parents back.

1497
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,390
You actually did it.

1498
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,680
So...

1499
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,770
I guess the plan is

1500
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:16,150
to douse yourself in industrial chemicals

1501
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,940
while electrocuting yourself?

1502
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,150
Yep.

1503
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,410
Want some help?

1504
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,700
Hell yeah.  That would be incredibly useful.

1505
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,410
I've actually already borrowed some chemicals

1506
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,660
and your soldering iron,

1507
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,830
and I'm sitting in your bat-seat.

1508
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,420
Is that like a faux pas?

1509
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:51,020
Wilco, Lima, Zebra, be advised...

1510
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,520
Air Command to Bravo 601.

1511
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:59,020
Primary teams, please confirm your AORs.

1512
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,300
You bring me nothing?

1513
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,260
I gave you a warning.

1514
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:31,010
Your failure to deliver the Kryptonian traitor

1515
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,890
is being taken as an act of war.

1516
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,810
Fire, fire, fire!

1517
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:38,060
Weapons hot! Weapons hot! Open fire!

1518
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,400
No.

1519
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,560
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1520
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:17,390
the current should run up the wire and draw the lightning right to the kite.

1521
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,940
Here, put that on.

1522
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,770
It's heat and impact resistant.

1523
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:21,900
Should protect you a little.

1524
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,320
Right, but the point is for me to not be protected.

1525
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,030
Okay.

1526
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,200
You're gonna need to be out of the way.

1527
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:32,410
I will.

1528
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:37,790
Let's get electrocuted.

1529
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,050
This is going to work, right?

1530
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,420
Of course it's gonna work.

1531
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,550
Nothing we haven't done before.

1532
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,430
Besides, this time we have Batman.

1533
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:51,680
What could go wrong?

1534
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,260
Uh, for the record, I think this is insane.

1535
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,140
Get back.

1536
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,270
It's fine. It's fine.

1537
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,950
Just you and me again, Mr. Lightning.

1538
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:23,710
Do it!

1539
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,570
Wait, what? No!

1540
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,940
No, wait! Stop!

1541
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,030
Stop!

1542
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:57,660
Oh, God.

1543
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,160
Oh, God.

1544
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,790
Barry, no.

1545
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,210
Go again.

1546
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,090
But...

1547
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,460
Please.

1548
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,260
The circuit is fried.

1549
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,780
I've got you.

1550
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,270
Hey.

1551
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:51,650
Barry.

1552
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,570
You're okay. It's like last time, right?

1553
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,530
So, you gotta heal now.

1554
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:15,720
Look, look, look!

1555
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,220
It's working. It's working.

1556
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,720
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1557
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,640
Yeah, he's healing. He's healing.

1558
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,430
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1559
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:25,140
Dude, you scared the shit out of me.

1560
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:10,140
You're awake.

1561
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:11,900
How you feeling?

1562
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:13,770
Slow.

1563
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,190
Maybe this will help.

1564
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,660
Yes!

1565
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:30,920
Dude, come on!

1566
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,290
Irresistible!

1567
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:34,040
Man, feels good to be back.

1568
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:35,090
Yeah!

1569
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,960
And what are we wearing tonight?

1570
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:37,840
You like it?

1571
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,220
I-I made it myself out of that old Batsuit.

1572
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,430
But you know, I made it our colors and everything.

1573
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:43,640
Well, check this out!

1574
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,640
It's a bit more loose.

1575
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,180
It beeves.

1576
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,190
Dude...

1577
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,020
you really mean that?

1578
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,150
I mean, I don't...

1579
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:59,320
I don't know what it means, exactly, to beeve.

1580
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,910
But it seems like it's positive.

1581
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,070
What are you doing?

1582
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,080
You came back.

1583
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,660
I'm glad you're okay.

1584
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,290
I have to ask you something.

1585
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:14,670
When you found me in that hole that they put me in...

1586
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,670
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1587
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,670
why did you help me?

1588
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,680
Because you needed help.

1589
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,390
Do you know what this symbol stands for?

1590
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,390
Supergirl?

1591
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:31,640
It means hope, right?

1592
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,190
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1593
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:36,770
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1594
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:40,320
We are a people of hope,

1595
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:42,200
not war.

1596
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,280
I'm coming to you live from Metropolis, where minutes ago, the mysterious flying...

1597
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,040
Zod may be from Krypton,

1598
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,830
but he is not my people.

1599
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:54,580
So, you're saying...

1600
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:55,670
Yes.

1601
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,840
I will help you fight Zod.

1602
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,800
Yes!

1603
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,340
Interesting group.

1604
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,510
What did you say, uh...

1605
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:08,680
we were called again?

1606
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:10,640
We're the Justice League.

1607
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,770
No.

1608
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:12,890
-No? -Well,

1609
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,890
I mean, kinda.

1610
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,940
We are short

1611
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,270
one literal goddess...

1612
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,020
one friendly Terminator

1613
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,900
and super mermaid.

1614
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,900
And we could definitely use a Batman.

1615
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:29,030
Are you in?

1616
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:35,830
You wanna get nuts?

1617
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,420
Let's get nuts.

1618
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:55,440
In my world, Superman showed up right away when Zod called him out.

1619
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,900
So, as of now, we're in uncharted territory.

1620
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:58,900
What I do know is

1621
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,150
that Zod somehow controls the World Engines,

1622
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,280
which will be destroying much more

1623
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,030
than just Metropolis now

1624
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:06,030
with every passing second that we don't stop him.

1625
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:07,200
Barry, what are you doing?

1626
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,280
What?

1627
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,330
Our kids are gonna wanna see this.

1628
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:12,700
Your kids?

1629
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:16,040
Well, you know, like everybody's kids.

1630
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,540
I mean, the children of the world.

1631
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:18,920
They're gonna wanna see this.

1632
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,670
We're getting close.

1633
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,300
I'm gonna stay airborne and take out their sky power.

1634
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,340
And Barry, just so we're clear

1635
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,760
what that essentially equates to is you and me versus the entire Kryptonian army.

1636
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:30,890
Chill.

1637
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:33,260
We need to buy Kara enough time to take out Zod.

1638
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:36,390
Oh, and remember that your suit doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1639
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,440
so you need to take breaks, otherwise you're gonna build up too much charge.

1640
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:40,770
Wait, what?

1641
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:02,710
Hold on!

1642
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,420
Hold on.

1643
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,050
The humans we came to protect?

1644
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:11,640
They don't know we're on their side.

1645
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,960
Zod.

1646
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,520
Kara Zor-El.

1647
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,310
We've been waiting for you.

1648
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:12,410
-Drag him out, drag him! -You go! I'll cover!

1649
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:32,720
Okay, and the space giant...

1650
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,430
and Mistress Murder... are our responsibility, too?

1651
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,060
Don't think about them, okay? Calm down.

1652
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,680
We're just gonna start with those guys over there.

1653
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:42,020
And yeah, they're Kryptonian, and we won't be able to kill them,

1654
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,810
but we can slow them down for her.

1655
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,020
One at a time.

1656
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:46,810
Okay?

1657
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:49,280
I'm gonna disarm them, and then you'll engage.

1658
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,190
Punch 'em.

1659
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,910
Come on, Barbie.

1660
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,030
Let's go party?

1661
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,290
Okay, ow!

1662
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:15,180
Okay. It's okay.

1663
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,390
You're okay. Come on.

1664
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,390
Jesus, they're fast.

1665
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,270
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1666
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:25,690
Terraforming has begun.

1667
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:27,440
This world must die

1668
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,520
so that ours may live again.

1669
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,030
Oh, my God. We gotta go. We gotta go.

1670
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,160
Dan, Danny, go,

1671
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,200
go!

1672
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,410
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1673
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,540
Your uncle...

1674
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,920
Jor-El...

1675
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:49,420
hid the key

1676
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,670
to Krypton's rebirth

1677
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,550
inside a Kryptonian child.

1678
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,260
All the genetic material needed to start again

1679
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:00,890
coded inside the DNA,

1680
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,640
then sent to Earth in an escape pod.

1681
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,020
He's not here. You have failed.

1682
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,940
We found him.

1683
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:11,900
We intercepted his pod.

1684
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,820
But your cousin was not the one we needed.

1685
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:20,160
You are the one.

1686
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,910
Kara Zor-El.

1687
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,660
It is your blood...

1688
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:25,410
we must harvest.

1689
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:26,920
What did you do to Kal-El?

1690
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,170
Your sacrifice that will allow

1691
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:31,710
Krypton to live again.

1692
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:34,050
What did you do?

1693
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,720
The infant did

1694
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,550
not survive.

1695
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,210
Look, new plan.

1696
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,840
I'm gonna create a cyclonic diversion.

1697
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,670
And you're gonna just come in, hard.

1698
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,930
Feet first this time.

1699
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:35,650
Yes!

1700
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,900
Barry, did you see that?

1701
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,950
Be careful. You're accumulating too much charge.

1702
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,660
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1703
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,830
No, no, no!

1704
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,070
Barry, that was actually only half stupid!

1705
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:18,070
But if you're gonna do that and not die,

1706
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,650
you need to complete the circuit somehow.

1707
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,280
Try putting your hands together, like this.

1708
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:26,070
Oh, shit.

1709
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:28,830
You're ready.

1710
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:31,160
Let's go!

1711
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,590
? I seem to think I think I got a little situation ?

1712
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,890
? So listen to me,

1713
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:47,640
sister Listen maybe you can help ?

1714
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,520
? I think I gave a lot of Problems my consideration ?

1715
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,390
? But not for me It always seem to be For someone else ?

1716
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,150
? Why all the people always Seem to just be on vacation ?

1717
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:59,030
? What do I get from it I don't get anything at all ?

1718
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,150
? I'm like a trash can Holding all the information ?

1719
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,950
? And every single time It leaves me Feeling two feet tall ?

1720
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:16,670
? And only one I'm taking ?

1721
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:48,950
I'm going after the big one.

1722
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:01,210
I've been hit.

1723
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,090
Bruce, do you copy?

1724
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,720
Where's Kara?

1725
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,930
You go find her.

1726
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,520
Bruce!

1727
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,770
Ejection mode failure. Ejection mode failure.

1728
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:00,060
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1729
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:06,820
Going down.

1730
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:13,280
But I'm not going alone.

1731
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:14,540
No, no, no,

1732
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,580
Bruce!

1733
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,410
Bruce, eject!

1734
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,920
Bruce, just eject...

1735
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,170
No!

1736
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,020
Kara.

1737
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,440
Isn't supposed...

1738
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:51,570
Not supposed to happen...

1739
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,040
Kara's dead.

1740
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,580
They're both dead.

1741
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,290
But they don't have to be, right?

1742
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:05,040
'Cause we can go back.

1743
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:06,420
Like you did.

1744
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,670
You're not fast enough yet.

1745
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,800
You sure?

1746
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,680
Barry!

1747
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,390
Barry, wait!

1748
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,150
Is this back enough?

1749
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,780
Yeah, I guess so.

1750
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,040
Listen, Barry, I...

1751
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,410
What?

1752
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:44,920
It's okay. We can fix this.

1753
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:48,050
You know what you're gonna change? I know what I'm gonna change.

1754
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:54,800
I'm going after the big one.

1755
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:59,390
Bruce, pull off. That gunship is shield-protected.

1756
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,520
Roger that.

1757
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,190
Bet he's not.

1758
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:06,900
Who?

1759
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,020
Space giant?

1760
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,070
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1761
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:52,190
Yes.

1762
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,810
No.

1763
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,400
It'll be okay.

1764
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,280
Not this time, kid.

1765
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,320
Maybe some other time.

1766
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,210
We can't bring you back, can we?

1767
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:13,170
You already did.

1768
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:16,550
You already did.

1769
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:28,390
Come on, Barry.

1770
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,060
Gotta get up. Come on.

1771
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:31,940
Barry.

1772
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:33,020
We go again.

1773
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:36,150
Barry.

1774
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,780
Let's just go.

1775
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:42,070
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1776
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,660
Barry, there's no point.

1777
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:47,410
Barry!

1778
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,390
Phase!

1779
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,060
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1780
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,820
-I have to pull it out. -No, I'm okay.

1781
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,900
You have to phase again. Barry, phase again. I'm okay. I just should've stopped sooner.

1782
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,840
Again.

1783
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,670
Barry.

1784
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:52,140
Okay, can we please just take a minute?

1785
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,310
Sorry, dude.

1786
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,060
Yeah, bro, of course.

1787
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,310
That's the whole thing.

1788
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,570
We can take as much time as it takes.

1789
01:56:58,650 --> 01:56:59,440
No,

1790
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,030
that's not what I mean. Hey!

1791
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:23,920
Okay, you good?

1792
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,800
Come on. I need you in there.

1793
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,680
Let's go.

1794
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,470
Barry, please, just listen to me!

1795
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,530
Where were you?

1796
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:49,450
What, you just stand here the whole time?

1797
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,330
Barry,

1798
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:52,450
this is an inevitable intersection.

1799
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,540
You have to stop. Barry!

1800
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,140
No, Barry, wait!

1801
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:18,270
Barry, listen.

1802
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:20,560
There's something I should tell you.

1803
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,280
I went back in time initially

1804
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:26,530
because...

1805
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:28,030
Yeah, because Mom died.

1806
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:29,660
How do you know?

1807
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:30,910
It doesn't matter.

1808
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,160
Does it?

1809
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,660
You know that I have to undo what I did.

1810
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,330
No.

1811
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:37,410
It's not a mistake.

1812
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,670
We can save her.

1813
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,040
And we can save them.

1814
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:41,420
No, we can't.

1815
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,050
This is what Bruce was talking about.

1816
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:45,920
Barry, this is inevitable.

1817
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,920
We can try a million times,

1818
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:49,680
and we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1819
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,550
No matter what we do...

1820
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:54,010
this world dies.

1821
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:56,010
Today.

1822
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:58,180
Look around.

1823
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:04,520
Look at the damage we're causing.

1824
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,660
Now we have to stop. Okay?

1825
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,910
Look, I was just doing my laundry.

1826
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:16,040
You're the one who came

1827
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,040
and told me that I'm a superhero.

1828
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,960
And now you're saying what?

1829
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,540
You don't want me to be?

1830
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,920
Well, guess what! It's too late!

1831
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,050
I am...

1832
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:28,300
...the Flash.

1833
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:30,220
And I can save everyone.

1834
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:31,970
Nobody dies!

1835
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:33,050
Barry...

1836
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:37,020
not every problem has a solution.

1837
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:47,940
Not every problem has a solution.

1838
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:53,280
Sometimes we just have to let go.

1839
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:55,450
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1840
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,780
Let go

1841
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,290
of Mom?

1842
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:02,040
She'll always be alive, somewhere in time.

1843
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,960
Always.

1844
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,840
Just not for us.

1845
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,550
You're full of shit, dude.

1846
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:10,170
I'm going back.

1847
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:12,340
You're going back to kill Mom?

1848
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,430
No!

1849
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:14,800
You're staying!

1850
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:17,760
You stay, right here.

1851
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,430
Just give me one more time.

1852
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:22,190
Barry, stop!

1853
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,270
You, stop!

1854
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:58,010
Feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

1855
02:00:58,510 --> 02:00:59,510
Let's start again.

1856
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:01,020
I'm the Flash.

1857
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:02,390
What's your name?

1858
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,810
I've lived...

1859
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:06,400
more than you can dream.

1860
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:08,440
Not an answer.

1861
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,530
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1862
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:19,530
Get out of here, Barry!

1863
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:35,930
That scar, you...

1864
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:38,550
Oh, my God.

1865
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:40,140
So, you're...

1866
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:41,510
You are...

1867
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,180
Yes, I am...

1868
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:44,770
you.

1869
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:49,150
We are so close.

1870
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,520
I've got it almost figured out.

1871
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:54,690
How long have you been doing this?

1872
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,780
Time is inconsequential.

1873
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,660
Come on, Barry.

1874
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,170
Up in the sky! It's a bird!

1875
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:11,790
It's a plane!

1876
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,420
It's Superman!

1877
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:57,550
Purrfectly foolproof.

1878
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:00,840
Only the Joker would think of that.

1879
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:41,430
Please just look at what's happening.

1880
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:44,140
These worlds...

1881
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,770
...they're colliding and collapsing.

1882
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,650
We did this.

1883
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:02,910
W-We're destroying the fabric of everything.

1884
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,410
You have to stop.

1885
02:04:06,450 --> 02:04:09,330
It stops once I've fixed it!

1886
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,920
It's not entirely your fault, Barry.

1887
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:17,300
I pushed you out of the Chronobowl on that September 29

1888
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,460
so you could start me on this path.

1889
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:23,050
How do you like our endless paradox?

1890
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:25,800
I made you create me...

1891
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:28,180
and now you're the one...

1892
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:30,640
in my way.

1893
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:33,900
No matter how close I get to winning this fight...

1894
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,020
you go back

1895
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,820
and let Mom die.

1896
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:40,820
You're the inevitable intersection.

1897
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,950
And you do have to let go.

1898
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:45,160
What's he talking about?

1899
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,030
You're my hero.

1900
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:02,550
What did you do?

1901
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,970
Hey, hey. Don't worry. It's gonna heal.

1902
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,300
It's gonna heal.

1903
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,260
I just wanted to...

1904
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:28,580
You tell Mom I love her.

1905
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,560
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1906
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,830
I used to love that cereal when I was a kid.

1907
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,540
Yeah.

1908
02:06:59,290 --> 02:07:00,830
My son goes nuts for it.

1909
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:06,340
They stop making it.

1910
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:08,720
Well, I know they were talking

1911
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,800
about discontinuing it.

1912
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,680
Do I know you?

1913
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,680
No, I'm not from around here.

1914
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:14,140
I was just visiting my mom.

1915
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,890
Maybe I know her.

1916
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:17,060
What's her name?

1917
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,390
She's the best...

1918
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:22,940
and kindest person in the world.

1919
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:23,940
You okay?

1920
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:25,150
Yeah, I'm just...

1921
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:27,190
I'm really gonna miss her.

1922
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:52,180
I know I'm just... a random lady in a store.

1923
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,550
But do you want a hug?

1924
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,220
Sure.

1925
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,400
I'm sorry.

1926
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,560
Oh, don't say that.

1927
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:08,690
Your mom must be grateful you came to visit her.

1928
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:10,950
She's very lucky to have you.

1929
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:20,290
I'm very lucky to have her.

1930
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:23,460
You have to tell her that.

1931
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:26,340
Moms like to hear these kind of things.

1932
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:28,170
Believe me.

1933
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:08,540
Love you, Mom.

1934
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:17,800
I love you more.

1935
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:21,810
I loved you first.

1936
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,650
Bye.

1937
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:28,900
Bye.

1938
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:03,140
I'm back.

1939
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:14,780
Shit!

1940
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:16,400
Court!

1941
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:28,420
...original trial was initially...

1942
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:32,670
I'm so sorry.

1943
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:38,840
As I was saying...

1944
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:42,640
the same security camera footage, Exhibit F in the original trial,

1945
02:10:43,890 --> 02:10:45,890
was initially considered useless,

1946
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:47,640
but has now

1947
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:51,650
been enhanced, using the latest tech

1948
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:53,400
from Wayne Enterprises.

1949
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,280
It confirms the alibi

1950
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:58,820
Mr. Allen has argued,

1951
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,660
and his son, Barry,

1952
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:04,580
has corroborated, since day one.

1953
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:11,540
Here.

1954
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:18,340
Right here, you can clearly see my client, Mr. Allen,

1955
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,390
reaching for a can of tomatoes on the top shelf.

1956
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:43,530
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us a bit more about what happened, please?

1957
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:45,290
Well, um...

1958
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:48,710
the tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to the top shelf,

1959
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:50,040
and subsequently,

1960
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:52,540
uncooked the spaghetti.

1961
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:54,420
Unquote.

1962
02:11:56,670 --> 02:11:58,300
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no sense.

1963
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:59,550
What are you talking about, sir?

1964
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:00,720
Thank you.

1965
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:02,300
Thank you so much.

1966
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:04,550
We're good here. Thank you.

1967
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,140
Did I give a good quote?

1968
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,890
Yeah. Spaghetti.

1969
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:13,650
Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking, um...

1970
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,320
you should ask me to dinner.

1971
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:19,320
D-Dinner with me?

1972
02:12:19,690 --> 02:12:21,700
Yes, a date, Barry.

1973
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:23,820
Iris West, do you wanna dinner-date me?

1974
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:25,530
I'd love to.

1975
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:26,580
Thank you.

1976
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,040
I'd love to also.

1977
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,040
Call me.

1978
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:52,190
Bruce!

1979
02:12:52,270 --> 02:12:53,140
Congratulations.

1980
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:54,020
Thank you.

1981
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:56,520
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.

1982
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:59,030
I... I have so much to tell you the next time I see you, Bruce.

1983
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:01,400
You were right. Okay? And I didn't listen.

1984
02:13:01,530 --> 02:13:03,280
And things did get very, very weird,

1985
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,410
but I put everything back, I promise.

1986
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:06,660
I'm pulling up now.

1987
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,030
Oh, great.

1988
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:10,540
Sir, sir!

1989
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:12,910
- Back up, please. - Shot!

1990
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:20,920
Was it backed by your own allegation?

1991
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,220
Who the fuck is this?

1992
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,050
He's not answering any questions.

1993
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:29,050
Hey, Barry.

1994
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:31,520
No, wh-where's...

1995
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:33,640
You're, you...

1996
02:13:33,890 --> 02:13:35,020
No. You can't...

1997
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,400
You...

1998
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:37,900
You're not Batman.

1999
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:41,570
What's wrong with you?

2000
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:31,070
? When the morning comes ?

2001
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:36,470
? When the morning comes ?

2002
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:42,550
? When the morning comes ?

2003
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:49,480
? When the morning comes ?

2004
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,120
? When the morning comes ?

2005
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:54,520
? When the morning comes ?

2006
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,760
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2007
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:58,560
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2008
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,730
? When the morning comes ?

2009
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:03,130
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2010
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:05,200
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2011
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:07,140
? When the morning comes ?

2012
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:08,870
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2013
02:15:08,910 --> 02:15:10,710
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2014
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:12,780
? When the morning comes ?

2015
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:14,910
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2016
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,780
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2017
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:18,720
? When the morning comes ?

2018
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:21,150
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2019
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:22,920
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2020
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:25,450
? When the morning comes ?

2021
02:15:25,490 --> 02:15:27,390
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2022
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:29,320
? You can't keep lettin' it Get you down ?

2023
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:30,860
? When the morning comes ?

2024
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:36,520
I've told you it's my metabolism, right?

2025
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,270
I can't get drunk.

2026
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:39,770
I can't get drink either.

2027
02:22:39,810 --> 02:22:40,810
Listen.

2028
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:41,900
Listen, I'm,

2029
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:42,780
'cause I'm trying to... No, no, no.

2030
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:45,400
'Cause what I'm trying to explain as simply as I possibly can, I promise...

2031
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:46,530
They were all Batman.

2032
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:47,780
They were all Bruce Wayne.

2033
02:22:48,070 --> 02:22:50,030
But each of them was a completely different person.

2034
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:52,040
So, on the other line-time...

2035
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:53,080
Timeline.

2036
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:54,330
...I'm the same guy?

2037
02:22:54,410 --> 02:22:56,080
Yeah. Actually, pretty much.

2038
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,710
You're lovable, furry...

2039
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:59,790
loyal, motivated by bacon.

2040
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:01,540
All right, listen.

2041
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:03,960
Thank you for making it more simpler for me,

2042
02:23:04,050 --> 02:23:04,840
Mr. Simple More.

2043
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:05,920
Yeah, I'm doing my best.

2044
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:08,550
Look, you're missing the larger premise here.

2045
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:10,430
In my timeline,

2046
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:11,470
when I...

2047
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,390
All right, come on.

2048
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:16,680
Up, up, Broseidon.

2049
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:18,020
All right, come on.

2050
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:20,310
I thought you were gonna sleep on the couch.

2051
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,520
Arthur, I live right here.

2052
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:23,570
Harry?

2053
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,650
I live right here. It's okay.

2054
02:23:31,070 --> 02:23:32,070
Okay.

2055
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:33,280
Oh, hey.

2056
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:35,790
More beer.

2057
02:23:36,330 --> 02:23:37,160
Go fast.

2058
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:38,040
Oh, here!

2059
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:38,920
Here.

2060
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:40,080
Here.

2061
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,040
Pay with this.

2062
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,460
Arthur, this is Atlantean treasure.

2063
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,840
You... You tell them that.

2064
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:49,720
? Got no money For the sailor suit I... ?

2065
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:51,300
-Yep. -? I'm a sailor... ?

2066
02:23:51,430 --> 02:23:52,430
You're a sailor.

2067
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:54,180
He's fine.
