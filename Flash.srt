早上好 想点些什么
Morning. What can I get you?

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,910
那位卷发女士呢
Where's curly-hair lady?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,710
萨拉吗
Sara?

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,790
她生病了 反正她请假时是这么说的
She's out sick. Or at least, that's what she says.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,540
其实是交新男友了
She's got a new boyfriend.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,590
想点什么 跟我说就行
What can I get you?

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,130
我通常都点一样的
Usually it's my usual

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,760
我赶时间 她会提前备好
and she usually has it ready because I'm usually late.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,630
那就快点儿告诉我吧
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,760
PB和BRHC组合三明治
Um, it's a PB and BRHC on a roll.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,930
我记一下
Okay, so...

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,760
PB指的是花生酱 我没猜错吧 没错
-"PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming? -Yes.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,680
BR是香蕉 葡萄干

H是蜂蜜 C是奶酪
"H," honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,560
新陈代谢快的人真是有口福
Aren't you blessed with a fast metabolism.

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,440
你这是要去跑马拉松吗
Are you running a marathon or something?

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,520
说起来 我妹妹倒是跑过一次
You know, my sister ran a marathon once,

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,690
老天保佑她
God rest her soul.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,150
人没事 就是累得半死不活
She's not dead. She's just exhausted.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,280
不就是跑了个步吗 莎伦
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,200
但我们早上都要去上班啊
But everyone has to work in the morning.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,950
是啊 我上班已经迟到三分钟了
Yeah, I have to go to work, three minutes ago.

27
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,200
不好意思 我想快点儿吃到我的三明治
And, sorry, I'm in sort of a rush for the sandwich.

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,660
老兄 心急可吃不到好三明治啊
You can't rush a good sandwich, dude.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,710
（阿尔弗雷德）

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,670
阿尔弗雷德 等会儿说
Alfred, really can't talk.

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,300
早上好啊 艾伦先生
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
不好 我迟到了
No, I'm late.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,510
而且快饿死了 卷发姑娘今天不在
And I'm starving, and curly-haired girl isn't here

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,550
她叫萨拉 有男朋友
and her name is Sara, and she has a boyfriend.

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,680
哥谭总医院这边出乱子了
We have a situation at Gotham General.

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,260
是由抢劫引发的
A robbery gone wrong.

37
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,390
现在可是大白天
This is the middle of the morning.

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,560
我们那位蝙蝠朋友不是应该在睡觉吗
Why is our bat-friend even awake?

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
叫超人去
Call Superman.

40
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,520
我先想到的他
That was my first thought.

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,810
可惜他正在忙别的事
Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.

42
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,810
这是一座位于中美洲的活火山
...active volcano in Central America.

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,690
（突发新闻 危地马拉一火山爆发）

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
又是这样
Classic.

45
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,070
戴安娜呢
What about Diana?

46
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,320
我也考虑过了
My other first thought.

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
可她不接电话 我能有什么办法
Rather annoyingly, she's not picking up.

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,320
原来是找不到其他人了
How many first thoughts, exactly,

49
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,700
才想起来找我的 是吧
did you have before you first thought of me?

50
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,950
跟她有什么关系
...never about her.

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,700
是关乎你自己的 抱歉 我的三明治好了吗
-This is about you. -Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

52
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,910
去年在船上时 我算是长教训了
I learned my lesson on the boat last year.

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
我的那个妹妹可真是酒后吐真言
Stuff my sister comes out with when she's drunk.

54
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,080
就连对我妈妈的朋友也是一通数落
Personal comments about my mom's friends as well,

55
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,790
她居然好意思说别人
which I think is what I say about her...

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,890
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

57
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,010
是闪电侠
Flash!

58
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,180
你好
Hi.

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,060
我爱你I love you.

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,930
谢谢
Thank you.

61
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,310
我觉得你人也很好
You seem very nice also.

62
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,390
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,520
让韦恩先生跟你说
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

64
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,020
别 拜托
No, please don't.

65
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,780
抱歉 这么问你可能有点儿怪
Oh, my God. Sorry if this sounds weird,

66
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,690
那个巧克力棒 你还吃吗
but are you actively eating that candy bar?

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,650
能扔给我吗
Maybe you could throw it to me?

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
以正义的名义
In the name of justice.

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,570
好啊 好啊
Yes, yes.

70
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
我需要你抓紧过来 巴里
I need you here now, Barry.

71
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,530
嗨 布鲁斯
Hi, Bruce.

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
知道了 我
Yes, I'm...

73
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,910
来了

74
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,670
剧名：闪电侠

75
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,670
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

76
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,460
（哥谭市）

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,770
糟了 各部门
No!

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,390
不 不
No, no!

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,030
布鲁斯 这里的情况简直糟透了
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

80
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,530
你人在哪儿呢
Why aren't you here?

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,010
布鲁斯 怎么听着像是你正在跑路啊
Bruce, why does it sound like you're fleeing the scene?

82
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,810
法尔科内的傻儿子想干票大的
Falcone's idiot kid decided to try to play in the big leagues.

83
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,890
召集了一伙人 闯进了哥谭总医院的实验室
He put a crew together and broke into the lab at Gotham General.

84
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,890
偷走了一种致命病毒

85
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,270
被我拦截时 他们炸开了一条出路
I intercepted them, but they blasted their way out.

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,940
医院那边就靠你了 巴里
You can handle the hospital, Barry.

87
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,400
我这边还得忙着拯救世界
Somebody has to save the rest of the world, so I was gonna do that.

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
希望你不要介意
If you don't mind.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,030
说得很在理 布鲁斯
Sounds about right, Bruce.

90
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,530
喂 小心

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,010
谢谢你从坑里救了我 闪电侠
"Thanks for saving me from the sinkhole, Flash."

94
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,760
在地下室
In the basement.

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
知道了
Right.

96
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,390
这就去
On it.

97
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,160
你那边能打开吗
Can you open it?

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,530
好像卡住了
-I think it's locked. -It's jammed.

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,530
天啊 打不开啊
God, it's not working!

100
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,950
拜托
Oh, please!

101
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,130
我说 阿尔弗雷德 我已经认了
Look, Alfred. I've come to accept

102
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,130
我在正义联盟里就是个收拾烂摊子的角色
that I'm essentially the janitor of the Justice League.

103
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,380
差事虽然苦
Which sucks.

104
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,140
但是我也认了
But I've come to accept it.

105
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,430
可是
But...

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,140
我怎么觉得
I can't help but notice...

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,060
每次这个烂摊子的罪魁祸首
that it always seems to be a bat-mess...

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,770
都是蝙蝠侠
that I'm cleaning up.

109
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,570
（停车）

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
当心
Look out!

111
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
小心

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,800
如果我的推算是正确的
If my calculations are correct,

113
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,890
从以往的经验来看 通常是正确的
and history will prove they usually are,

114
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,390
那么地基的损毁
the foundational damage is

115
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,270
将会导致整个东翼建筑的坍塌
about to cause the collapse of the east wing.

116
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
东翼没事啊
East wing's fine.

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,140
有我在
All right, I got you.

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
幸好没事 我速度要跟不上了
Which is good because my speed is lagging.

119
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,270
（热量过低）

120
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,310
我还饿着肚子呢 阿尔弗雷德
Running on empty, Alfred.

121
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,030
听见没
Do you hear that?

122
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,320
是我的肚子在叫
That's my stomach.

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
不 不
No, no.

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,660
是东翼坍塌的声音
It's the collapsing east wing.

125
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,510
巴里 30楼
Barry, 30th floor.

126
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,510
在下
There's a

127
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,550
宝宝
baby...

128
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
雨
Shower.

129
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,040
（能量达到峰值）

130
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,010
艾伦先生
Mr. Allen,

131
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,020
我太为你感到骄傲了
you've made me very proud.

132
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,640
妈妈们会很感激你的
And a lot of mothers very happy.

133
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
好了
Okay.

134
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,910
我知道
I understand

135
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,660
刚才发生的这一切可能会给你带来心理创伤
that these events can be psychologically scarring.

136
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,910
到时候你可以找心理咨询师寻求帮助
You should seek the services of a mental health professional.

137
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,710
在这方面 正义联盟暂时做得还不够好
The Justice League is not very good at that part yet.

138
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
相信我
Trust me.

139
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,290
天啊
God.

140
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,830
快甩掉他
Shake him off!

141
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,260
要是让那个公文包掉进水里
If that briefcase falls into the water,

142
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
（病毒传播模拟）

143
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,050
午饭前就可能有一半的哥谭市民丧命
it could wipe out half of Gotham by lunchtime.

144
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,510
该死
Damn it.

145
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,060
别松手啊
Please don't drop me.

146
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,890
天啊 求你了 千万别松手啊
Oh, God, no. Please, please don't.

147
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,070
抱歉 来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

148
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,290
小心台阶
Watch your step.

149
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
行头不错嘛
Nice suit.

150
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,590
很帅嘛 闪电侠
Looking good, Flash.

151
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,210
谢
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

152
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,050
至于你
And you...

153
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
不用谢我
are welcome.

154
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,510
我天性自负 从来不会跟别人道谢
My ego's far too big to say "thank you" to someone else.

155
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,890
我把自己塑造成个狠角色
I developed this... all-powerful persona

156
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,770
是为了弥补童年创伤
to compensate for my childhood trauma...

157
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,640
我也有童年创伤
I, too, have childhood trauma.

158
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,020
真言套索
The Lasso of Truth...

159
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,770
总是很灵
...never gets old.

160
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,650
我还不如把自己的钱都捐出去
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away.

161
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,280
消除犯罪的本质在于消除贫困
Yes, if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

162
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,780
我了解什么是亲热
I know sex exists.

163
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,030
我只是从没体验过而已
I've just never experienced it.

164
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,030
该死
Damn it.

165
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
我想
Well...

166
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,790
我该走了
I have to run.

167
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,830
好
Yeah.

168
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,660
不用客气
Always a pleasure.

169
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,790
我刚才只是想打个比方
The sex thing was a metaphor...

170
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,170
我想比喻的是哥特文学
for gothic literature.

171
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,630
根本就圆不回来了
There was just no way to recover from that.

172
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,670
别想了
Just let it go.

173
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,890
那个 我很想继续帮你收拾烂摊子
Well, I'd really love to stay and clean up more mess...

174
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,010
但我这个小超级英雄得去吃早饭了
but this little superhero needs his breakfast.

175
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
再见 闪电侠
Goodbye, Flash.

176
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,140
好吧 再见 蝙蝠侠
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

177
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,560
漂亮 韦恩先生
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

178
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,940
回家吃早饭吗 先生
Will you be home for breakfast, sir?

179
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,030
是的 我看行
Yes, I think so.

180
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,570
只会自取灭亡
...the road to destruction.

181
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,530
跟她有什么关系
This was never about her.

182
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,030
这是你自己的人生
This is about you.

183
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,660
一个人不能总是活在过去
You have to stop living in the past.

184
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,290
怎么样 我做得够快了吧
Now, was that fast enough for you?

185
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,170
（研究中心）

186
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,510
看看谁来了
Ah, look who's here.

187
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,010
闭嘴 阿尔伯特
Shut up, Albert.

188
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,890
整天迟到
Every day.

189
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,520
你怎么做到的 巴里
I don't know how you do it, Barry.

190
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,930
你是爬着来的吗 老兄
What'd you, like, crawl here, bro?

191
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,810
他生气了吗
Is he mad?

192
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,940
你饭碗要不保了
Well, you're getting fired.

193
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,890
小命都不保了
You're getting murdered.

194
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,770
先别解释
Oh, no, no, no.

195
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

196
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,020
你的闹钟没有响
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

197
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,940
不对 你的狗把闹钟吃了
-No-- -Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

198
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,900
你的闹钟把你的钥匙吃了
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

199
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,530
钥匙的奶奶去世了
Your keys' grandmother died,

200
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,820
所以它们都要请假
and they need a personal day.

201
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,030
那倒不至于
It was none of those things.

202
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,160
这次又有什么借口 巴里
What was it this time, Barry?

203
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,160
是有事耽搁了
It was, um, something else

204
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,950
但没您说的那么离谱
that was far less outlandish.

205
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,910
我知道我没赶上开会
And I know I missed the meeting...

206
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,290
但我还是想提交这些案件 看看能否再调查一下
but I'd still really like to present these case files for potential review.

207
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,670
我认为这些案件处理得太仓促了
I think we rushed these cases.

208
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,300
需要重新调查取证 仓促
-We need to reopen them. -Oh! Rushed?

209
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,050
我们已经积压了六个月的案件
We got a backlog six months deep,

210
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,510
你居然还想再慢一些吗
and you want us to move slower?

211
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,550
专注在那些要上庭的案件上
You need to focus your motion.

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,140
把手上的活儿干完 结案 然后继续
Do the work, close the case, move on.

213
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,060
你其实很有潜力 巴里
You have a lot of potential, Barry.

214
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,020
这么多年了 给我倒咖啡这种事早就不该你来做了
You shouldn't still be getting me coffee after all these years.

215
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,690
没错 您说得对
You're right. That's... That's true.

216
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,270
去给我倒杯咖啡
Go get me a coffee.

217
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,650
两块方糖 不然呢
Two sugars? Yeah.

218
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,690
好
Oh, yeah.

219
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
快来听好消息
You're gonna love this.

220
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,670
我对约翰逊一案的裁决感到满意
I'm very satisfied with the ruling in the Johnson case.

221
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,380
由我们的实验室所参与分析的证据
The evidence our lab analyzed...

222
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,760
足以给出充分的证明
was more than sufficient to be conclusive.

223
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,260
那些证据我还没分析完呢
-I'm still working that evidence. -Because of the diligence

224
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,640
而这要归功于我们工作人员的 辛勤付出和高度专注
and hard work and focus...

225
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,520
那些证据巴里还没分析完呢
Barry was still working on that evidence.

226
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,890
要是都听你的
Think if it were up to you

227
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,270
几十年前的杀人犯到现在都没法定罪
that we'd still be scraping Ted Bundy's molars.

228
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,940
我告诉你们 你们或许觉得这样的事情好笑
You know what? I'm so happy you find this all so hilarious,

229
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,400
但我们经手的可都是关乎人命的
but we are dealing with real people's lives,

230
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,400
他们可都有家庭
people's families.

231
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,570
你们根本认识不到事情的严重性
And I don't think you can grasp the gravity of that.

232
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,280
所以 别烦我了 行吗
So, why don't you leave me alone?

233
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,450
巴里艾伦
Barry Allen?

234
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,910
艾瑞斯韦斯特
Iris West.

235
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
你
You...

236
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,540
也知道我的全名
know my full name also.

237
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,410
我们是校友嘛
Yes, from school.

238
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,670
巴里 原来你还有学校的朋友啊
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us you had a friend from school.

239
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,710
我们都不知道他居然还有朋友
We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.

240
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,920
是啊 算算他有多少朋友
Yeah, what does that make it now?

241
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,800
一个
One?

242
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
一个 对
One.

243
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,670
你们俩真是
You guys are so...

244
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,680
再见 二位 好吧 再见
Um, bye, you guys.

245
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,260
知道了 我的天啊
Okay. Oh, my God.

246
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,390
我和他们俩并不熟 只是同事而已
That was just... They're not really my friends. They're my work friends.

247
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,430
你在这儿工作
Do you work here?

248
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,020
对 没错
Yes, I do.

249
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,560
真的好久没见了吧
God, it's been a long time, huh?

250
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,150
但我之前好像在哪儿见过你
I feel like we saw each other...

251
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,070
就前两年 对吗
like a few years ago, right?

252
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,780
没有 因为
No, because...

253
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,150
我们上一次见面还是在
we haven't seen each other since...

254
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,450
大学时
college.

255
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,080
也可能就是我想见你
Maybe I was just thinking about you.

256
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,290
不管怎样 很高兴能再遇到你
Well, I'm really glad I ran into you.

257
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,410
是吗 是啊
-Yeah. -Yeah.

258
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,540
你父亲的案子明天重审 对吧
Your father's appeal is tomorrow, right?

259
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,420
是 你怎么
Yeah. How...

260
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,170
抱歉 你是怎么知道的
Sorry, how do you know about that?

261
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,880
我在报社负责这篇报道
I'm covering it for the paper.

262
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,760
你父亲还好吗
How is he holding up?

263
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,760
这是采访的问题吗
Are you asking for the paper?

264
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,640
不是 是我作为朋友关心一下
No, I'm asking as a friend.

265
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
但我想公众肯定也会感兴趣的
Although I'm sure the public would want to know as well.

266
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,520
好吧
Well...

267
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,520
我只能告诉你 我爸爸是被冤枉的
my only official comment is that my dad is innocent.

268
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,570
当然
Right.

269
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,150
我是说 没有人
I mean, no one...

270
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,280
愿意相信自己的父亲会杀害自己的母亲
would want to believe that their father killed their mother.

271
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,330
什么叫相信 我爸爸根本就不该坐牢
What do you mean, "believe"? My dad shouldn't be in jail.

272
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,530
我妈妈也该活得好好的
My mom should be alive.

273
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,830
与我信不信无关
It's not about what I believe.

274
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
事实就是事实
It's about what the truth is.

275
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,660
当然 不 我是说
Right. No, yes, that's...

276
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,420
天啊 我本来就是这个意思
Oh, my God. That's what I meant.

277
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,210
好吧
Right.

278
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,790
抱歉 关于此案 我现在无可奉告
Sorry, I have no official comment at this time.

279
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,020
（机密物证 韦恩企业）

280
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,400
您有一通来自铁山监狱的
You have a collect call

281
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
（抱歉 布鲁斯韦恩）

282
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,030
对方付费电话
from the Iron Heights Penitentiary.

283
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,160
请问是否要接听
Do you wish to accept?

284
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
接听
Yes.

285
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
喂 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

286
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,040
喂 巴里
Hey, Barry.

287
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
你最近好吗
How ya doing?

288
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,160
挺好的
I'm fine.

289
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,330
有多出去走走吗
You getting out much?

290
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,410
有啊
Yeah.

291
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,330
好吧 没有
Well, no.

292
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
没有
Uh, no.

293
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,170
不过我碰到了一个大学时的朋友
But I, um, I ran into an old college friend...

294
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
艾瑞斯韦斯特 就今天
Iris West, today.

295
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,050
她不是你上学时的女神吗
Didn't you have a monster crush on her?

296
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,380
她现在有男朋友吗
Well, she have a boyfriend?

297
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,930
你怎么不约她出去
Why don't you ask her out?

298
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,550
爸爸 我
Dad, I, um...

299
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,520
我有个朋友帮忙 修复了那家超市以前的监控录像
I had a friend run the old security camera footage from the store...

300
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,640
用的是他研究的新程序
through this new program he's developed.

301
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,940
现在的画面很清晰
And it's crystal clear now.

302
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
只是
It's just...

303
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,900
你一直没抬头 爸爸
you never look up, Dad.

304
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,320
看不见你的脸
You can't see your face.

305
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,070
所以就没有新证据来支持你的不在场证明
So, without new evidence to support your alibi...

306
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,910
恐怕得开始研究下一次怎么上诉了
we're just gonna need to start thinking about the next appeal.

307
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,910
不 行了
No, uh-uh.

308
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,540
别再惦记着你老爸的事了
You need to stop worrying about your old man.

309
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,710
这样你才能有时间交女朋友啊
Do that, you might actually have time for a girlfriend.

310
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,920
可是 爸爸 我不想
But Dad, I don't want...

311
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,420
这条老路我们走过
We've done this before.

312
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,760
这已经是最后的努力了
This was a last-ditch effort...

313
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,050
明天就当是再走走过场
and we'll go through the motions tomorrow.

314
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,390
爸爸没事 真的
I'm okay, really.

315
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,930
要我说 我有时候觉得
You know, sometimes I even think

316
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,430
在牢里待着 反而对我来说更容易一些
it's probably easier for me to be in here

317
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
比起外面
than out there...

318
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
她不在了
without her.

319
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,190
在这儿还能有个念想 想象她还活着
'Cause this way, I can imagine she's alive...

320
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,520
好好地过日子
out there living her life.

321
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
巴里
Barry?

322
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
巴里
Barry?

323
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
你还在吗
You there?

324
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,780
在呢 爸爸
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

325
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,790
还记得她周日常做的那个酱汁吗
Hey, remember that sauce she'd make on Sundays?

326
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,830
满屋子都是罗勒草和西红柿的香味
The whole house would smell like basil, tomatoes.

327
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,340
她还喜欢穿我的衣服 边跳边唱
And she'd put on my sweats and start singing.

328
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,260
是啊 什么歌来着
Yeah, what was that song?

329
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,800
我喜欢那首歌
I loved that song.

330
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,640
牢记这些
Remember that part.

331
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,770
这不合理啊
It's not fair.

332
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,440
什么不合理 小猴子
What's not fair, Monkey?

333
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,900
这道题出得太蠢了
This question is stupid.

334
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,030
你能想出多少种计算结果为24的算法
How many calculations can you think of with an answer of 24?

335
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,690
这有无数种答案啊
There are a bajillion answers.

336
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,950
这怎么写得完啊
How am I supposed to fit them all?

337
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,900
你说得没错
You are right.

338
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,530
这个问题确实有无数种答案
There are a bajillion answers to this question.

339
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,910
有的问题注定无解
Not every problem has a solution.

340
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,910
有时候你得学会放弃
Sometimes you just have to let go.

341
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,160
让小脑瓜休息一下 来帮我做意面
Give your brain a rest and help me make the pasta.

342
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,210
快来
Come on.

343
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,090
不是吧
No.

344
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,960
（西班牙语）该死

345
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,920
亨利
Henry?

346
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,420
（西班牙语）怎么了 亲爱的

347
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,130
需要你帮我一个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

348
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,420
我不爱帮忙
I don't do favors.

349
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,300
好啊
Okay.

350
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,300
其实是巴里需要你帮忙
Barry needs you to do him a favor.

351
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,140
巴里啊 那没问题
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

352
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,890
我还需要一罐西红柿
I need another can of tomatoes.

353
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,930
这不是有吗
You have a can of tomatoes.

354
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,140
还需要一罐
I need another one.

355
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,150
你们早上不是去超市了吗
I thought you guys went to the store this morning.

356
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,310
但是我忘买西红柿了
But I forgot the tomatoes.

357
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,400
我倒是有个更好的主意
This looks way more fun.

358
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
不如让巴里去一趟超市
Let's just let Barry go to the store.

359
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,780
你会开车 对吧 小鬼
You drive, right, Squirm?

360
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,200
当然不会 你都这么大了
-What? No. -Getting so big.

361
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,160
肯定没问题 看看你
You can do anything. Look at ya.

362
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,530
甚至都有白头发了
You're getting gray, actually.

363
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,450
买绿皮罐头的 别买成蓝皮的 好吗
Green can, not the blue one, okay?

364
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,330
知道了
Got it.

365
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,160
买蓝皮罐头的 别买成绿皮的 对吧
Blue can, not the green one, right?

366
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,040
错了
No!

367
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,040
什么 是绿皮的 不是蓝皮的
Green can, not the blue one. What?

368
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,290
完蛋了
Oh, God.

369
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,670
她要开始唱歌了
She's gonna start singing.

370
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,010
快跑
Run!

371
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,880
巴里 快跑
Run, Barry!

372
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,890
歌词大意 就让这些美妙的歌声 道出我的心声

373
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,180
生活真的会给人惊喜

374
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,650
天啊 生活真会给人惊喜

375
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
我爱你 小猴子
I love you, Monkey.

376
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,070
我爱你更多
I love you more.

377
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,780
我爱你更早
I loved you first.

378
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
诺拉
Nora?

379
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,430
巴里
Barry!

380
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,890
不 别动 亲爱的

381
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,190
别碰它 别乱动 好吗

382
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
巴里
Barry!

383
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,810
巴里
Barry!

384
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,150
快打急救电话 快
Call 911 now!

385
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
巴里
Barry?

386
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,790
巴里
Barry?

387
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,580
别为明天担心了
Don't worry about tomorrow.

388
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,210
我们早就知道机会渺茫
We always knew it was a long shot...

389
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,830
爸爸
Dad?

390
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,130
您与来自铁山监狱的通话已结束
Your call with Iron Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.

391
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,160
巴里艾伦
Barry Allen?

392
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,410
但我之前好像在哪儿见过你

393
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,410
由我们的实验室
...evidence our lab...

394
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,700
专注在那些要上庭的案件上
You need to focus your motion.

395
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,210
把手上的活儿干完 结案
Do the work...

396
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,300
怎么样 我做得够快了吧
Now, was that fast enough for you?

397
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,180
你是说 你回到了过去
So, you're saying you went back in time?

398
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,390
像在波扎尔诺夫那次
Like in Pozharnov?

399
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,180
没错 只不过那次只有一秒钟左右
Yeah, like in Pozharnov, except, but Pozharnov was a second.

400
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,760
而这次我回溯了一整天的时间
This time I went back a whole day.

401
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,930
那我们就假设
So, let's imagine...

402
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,810
你的确有可能跑得足够快
that it is, in fact, possible for you to run...

403
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,650
比光速还要快
faster than the speed of light...

404
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,020
通过那么做 你能回到过去
and in so doing, travel back in time.

405
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,030
可是那么做
It still would be...

406
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,900
真的很不负责任
wildly irresponsible.

407
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
料到你会这么说
I knew you were gonna say this.

408
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,820
是啊
Yes,

409
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,030
巴里 因为如果你回到过去
because, Barry, if you were to go into the past,

410
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,910
和你父母或是你自己的任何互动
any interaction you have with your parents or yourself,

411
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,410
哪怕只是走错一步路
you step on the wrong blade of grass,

412
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,160
都有可能产生你根本想象不到的严重后果
you have no idea what the consequences to that could be.

413
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,080
我知道 蝴蝶效应 对吧
No, I know. The butterfly effect, right?

414
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,960
没错
Yes.

415
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,830
我懂
I get it.

416
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
可是 布鲁斯 我能解决问题
But Bruce... I could fix things.

417
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,210
同时你也可能毁灭一切
You could also destroy everything.

418
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
我能救她
I could save her.

419
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,180
能让他俩都得救 甚至
I could save both of them. I...

420
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,760
还能救你的父母
I could save your parents.

421
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,060
巴里 正是这些伤痕
Barry, these scars we have...

422
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,940
造就了我们
make us who we are.

423
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,900
不要想着去修复它们
We're not meant to go back and fix them.

424
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,690
现在的你很好 不需要去修复什么
And there's nothing broken with you that needs to be fixed.

425
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,410
就听我这个过来人的经验之谈吧
Take it from an old guy who's made a lot of mistakes.

426
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,530
不要活在过去
Don't live your past.

427
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,040
活好当下
Live your life.

428
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,910
不要让悲剧定义你
Don't let your tragedy define you.

429
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,790
如果我注定要被定义呢
What if it's supposed to define me?

430
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,540
悲剧让你成了英雄
Your tragedy made you a hero.

431
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,170
也让我孤身一人
And also made me alone.

432
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,390
这不有我吗
We could hang out.

433
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,390
要不去吃点儿东西
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

434
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,430
我还是很饿
Like, I'm still hungry.

435
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,180
这次就算了吧
Not this time.

436
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,020
下次再说吧
Maybe some other time.

437
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
好
Yeah.

438
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,660
车不错嘛
Nice ride.

439
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,160
你朋友很有钱嘛
You have fancy friends.

440
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,040
是我叫的网约车
Yeah, it was an Uber.

441
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
高端网约车
Exec.

442
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,540
艾瑞斯 我真不能和你聊案子的事
Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the case at all.

443
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,170
我此刻是朋友 不是记者
I'm not here as a reporter.

444
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,800
能聊聊吗
Can we talk?

445
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,510
请进
Come on in.

446
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,900
说实话 你这里比我想的整洁多了
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot tidier in here than I expected.

447
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,770
是吗
Yeah?

448
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,650
是
Yeah, well, um...

449
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,570
那好吧 我是个很爱干净的人
Yeah. I'm a pretty tidy person.

450
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,700
喝点儿东西吗
Can I offer you a drink?

451
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,580
好啊
Sure.

452
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
来瓶啤酒吧
I'll take a beer.

453
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,510
啤酒 啤酒 啤酒
Beers, beers, beers.

454
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,010
就放在冰箱里
I keep 'em in my fridge.

455
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,390
谢谢
Thanks.

456
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
客气
Sure.

457
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,640
那个 对于我之前说的那些话
Look, I feel really bad

458
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,150
我很过意不去
about earlier.

459
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,150
我应该考虑到你的心情
I should've been more sensitive.

460
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,530
我也许也不该那么敏感的
And, um, I probably could've been less sensitive.

461
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,330
我无法想象你都经历了什么
I mean, I can't imagine what you've been through.

462
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,410
几乎在同一天失去了双亲
It's like you lost both parents in one day.

463
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
的确是
I did.

464
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,170
母亲死于一场悲剧
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

465
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,090
而司法系统的漏洞又让我失去了父亲
and I lost my dad to the failures of the justice system.

466
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,800
所以你去了刑事取证部门
Is that why you got into criminal forensics?

467
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,880
试图修复司法系统
To try and fix the system?

468
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,890
是的
Yeah.

469
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
没错 修复
Yeah, to fix it.

470
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,270
肯定有办法修复 对吧
There's gotta be a way to fix it, right?

471
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,140
其实这也是我从事新闻业的原因
I mean, that's kinda why I got into journalism, too.

472
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,150
只要我能回到过去 我就能找到办法
I could make it right if I could just go back somehow

473
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,530
在他们不知情的状态下 给他们警告
and warn them without them knowing that I'd warned them.

474
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,400
你这么想
I... thinking like that's gonna...

475
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,200
会把自己逼疯的
...drive you crazy.

476
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,320
如果我能回到过去
"If I could just go back in time...

477
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,530
阻止凶手行凶就好了 这
and stop the guy who did it." It's...

478
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,030
不行 要是那么做 动静就太大了
No, I can't do that, 'cause that's way too much interaction.

479
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,210
我爸爸当时根本就不在家
My dad wasn't even at home.

480
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,710
因为我妈妈让他去买西红柿了
My mom sent him to go get a can of tomatoes.

481
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,210
当年那个歹徒可能以为家里没人
I think whoever broke into the house thought it was empty.

482
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,300
直到看见了我妈妈 她手里有刀
And then my mom was in there with the knife in her hand

483
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,880
于是情况变糟 看似荒谬的事接连发生
and things went bad, just this absurd chain of events.

484
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,430
这段录像本应成为我爸爸的不在场证明的
And it's like, this footage should've finally supported my dad's alibi.

485
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,510
然而却
But instead...

486
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,680
一罐西红柿毁了三个人的一生
three lives ruined for a can of tomatoes.

487
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,650
天啊
Oh, my God.

488
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
怎么
What?

489
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,780
有突破点了
Well, that could be it.

490
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,820
要是妈妈没忘买西红柿
If my mom doesn't forget the tomatoes in the first place,

491
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,160
爸爸就不会出门 妈妈也就不会死
then he never leaves and she never dies.

492
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,780
我不需要露面
No one would even have to see me.

493
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,580
这样也就没有布鲁斯说的互动
Bruce said no interaction. This is no interaction.

494
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,950
我可以快进快出
This is just quick in, quick out,

495
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,580
回到现在 跟从来没回去过一样
back to the present, like I was never even there.

496
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,460
就这么办 天啊 艾瑞斯
That's how I fix it. Oh, my God, Iris.

497
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,040
太感谢你了
Thank you, so much.

498
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,460
真是太好了
This has been great.

499
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,210
实在抱歉
I'm sorry.

500
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,920
我得走了
I... I have to leave.

501
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,510
好的 好
Okay. Right.

502
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,060
对了 聊得很开心 改天再约
I had a really great time, by the way. We should do this again.

卡尔-艾尔 氪星之子
Kal-El, son of Krypton.

504
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,780
这个主意糟透了
This is a bad idea.

505
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,580
这个主意糟透了
This is a bad idea.

506
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,410
这个主意糟透了
This is a bad idea.

507
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,040
看来你很快
So, you're fast.

508
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,710
你爸爸是个杀人犯
Your dad's a murderer.

509
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
你爸爸是个杀人犯
Your dad's a murderer.

510
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,800
（诺拉艾伦 爱妻与慈母）

511
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,010
快打急救电话 快
Call 911 now!

512
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,140
快
...now!

513
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,890
快
...now!

514
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,770
快
...now!

515
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,640
（西红柿罐头）

516
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,150
嗨 妈妈
Hi, Mom.

517
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,540
别忘了这罐西红柿
Don't forget the tomatoes.

518
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,050
回头见
See you soon.

519
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,390
要成功啊
Please work.

520
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,820
祝你生日快乐
? Happy Birthday, dear... ?

521
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,570
生日快乐 巴里
Happy Birthday, Barry.

522
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,290
加油 巴里 冲啊 加油
- Go, Barry, hurry up. - Go!

523
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,670
2013届的毕业生们 祝你们毕业快乐
Congratulations to the class of 2013!

524
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,830
妈妈好爱你

525
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,170
好爱你 妈妈好爱你
I love you so much.

526
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,440
（西班牙语）吓我一跳

527
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,650
小猴子
Monkey!

528
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,660
你穿的什么呀
What are you wearing?

529
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,030
巴里回来了 这么早
Is that Barry? And he's early?

530
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,830
太阳打西边出来了
What universe is this?

531
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,410
你剪头发了
You've cut your hair.

532
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,540
这下能看见眼睛了
Now you can see your eyes.

533
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,540
怎么变丑了
You look terrible.

534
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,420
亨利
Henry!

535
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,170
看着老了 我儿子多帅啊
-You look old. -You look beautiful, baby.

536
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,670
你在学校到底经历了什么
What are they doing to you over there?

537
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,170
别说了 我儿子多棒啊
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

538
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,760
来 抱抱
Come here.

539
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,640
我好爱你
I love you so much.

540
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,140
我也爱你
I love you, too.

541
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
我爱你更多
I love you more.

542
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,560
我爱你更早
I loved you first.

543
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,900
去洗个澡 换身衣服
Go take a shower and change.

544
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,400
一身臭鞋子味儿
You smell like a boot.

545
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
快去 快去
Go, go, go.

546
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,780
老了
"Old,"

547
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
真有你的
seriously?

548
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,530
好吧 我是说成熟了
Well, no, I mean like mature.

549
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,450
他这个年纪 看着成熟点儿好
He's at that age, he wants to look old.

550
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,530
比如 能混进酒吧
He, you know, gets into bars that way.

551
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,330
需要帮忙吗
How can I help?

552
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,290
妈妈 今天过得好吗
Hey, Mom, how was your day?

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
这个月 还有过去18年 都还好吗
How was your month, or your last 18 years?

554
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,340
好奇怪的问题
Or that's a weird question...

555
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,420
因为我也在
'cause I was here.

556
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,510
很明显 这些事我应该都记得才对
But obviously, we share those memories together.

557
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,390
要不 我们去创造些新的回忆
Or I don't know, maybe we could make some new memories.

558
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,050
比如去水族馆 或者马戏团
Like we could go to the aquarium, or the circus,

559
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
公园也行 你们可以推我荡秋千
or to the park and you could push me on a swing.

560
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,140
也好奇怪 因为我已经是成年人了
That's also weird because I'm an adult now,

561
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,190
完全可以自己荡秋千了
so I'd probably motivate my own motion on a swing.

562
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,310
对了 这周在学校过得怎么样啊
So, how was it this week? How's school?

563
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,150
在学校 我过得好着呢
At school was... is good.

564
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,530
一切都好
School's been great.

565
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,070
我有好好学习 学我的那些
I've just been working really hard there on my...

566
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,320
专业课
studies.

567
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,160
约经济学课上那个姑娘了吗
Did you ask out that girl from econ?

568
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,790
我知道大一新生通常应该
I know freshman year is about

569
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,160
多参加活动 结识新朋友
going out, meeting people, okay?

570
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,790
还有多探索
Exploring things.

571
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,790
多尝试新鲜事物
Experimenting.

572
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,670
但是 还是要多谨慎一点儿
But you have to be very careful.

573
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,210
糟了
Oh, shit.

574
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,680
我突然想上厕所
I... have to shit.

575
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,050
我去了
Outside.

576
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,560
救命
Help!

577
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,270
你怎么在这儿
Why are you here?

578
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,690
今年是哪年
What year is it?

579
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,030
别乱动 救命
-No, no, no. -Help!

580
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,030
这是我的脸
That's my face.

581
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,910
你偷了我的脸
You stole my face.

582
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,700
是致幻蘑菇导致的吗
Think I'm having a mushroom flashback?

583
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,660
有可能吗
Is that a thing?

584
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,910
你多大了
How old are you?

585
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,460
18岁
Eighteen.

586
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,010
这也太魔幻了
This is mad trippy.

587
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,510
那我们这是在未来
So, we're, like, in the future.

588
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,390
不是 等一下
No, wait.

589
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,310
一点儿也不魔幻 老弟
This is not trippy, dude.

590
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,520
简直是飞来横祸
This is catastrophic.

591
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,770
这也不是未来
And no, we're not in the future.

592
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,650
我本该回到原来的时空
I was supposed to be back in the present,

593
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,690
但我还在过去
but I'm still in the past.

594
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,400
不应该有两个我
And there's not supposed to be two of me.

595
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,280
你和我不该出现在同一个时空里
You and I are not supposed to be occupying the same reality at all,

596
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,400
更不该像这样互动
let alone interacting.

597
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,320
真不敢相信我是个能够穿越时空的超级英雄
I just can't believe I'm a superhero who time travels--

598
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,200
不 你还什么都不是
No, no, no. You are not anything.

599
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,080
这是好事
Which is good.

600
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,950
你不会想当超级英雄的 太可怕了
You don't want to be a superhero. It's scary.

601
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,660
而且跑起来时 牙缝里全是小虫子
And I get bug splatter in my teeth all the time.

602
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,910
厉害
Awesome.

603
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,460
再表演一遍
Hey, do the thing again.

604
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,710
不行 没时间了
No, we don't have time.

605
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,300
妈妈
Mom!

606
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,170
你干吗 还想告状
What are you doing? You're gonna tattle now?

607
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,630
再来一遍
Do the thing.

608
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
好吧
Fine.

609
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,430
爽
Yeah. Yeah.

610
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,310
满意了吗
Happy?

611
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,140
满意了 再放回去
Now undo it.

612
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,160
好疼
Ow.

613
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,420
巴里 你在楼上没事吧
Barry, are you okay up there?

614
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,790
我们没事
We're fine!

615
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,830
我没事
I'm fine! Okay, Monkey.

616
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,920
你们有可以水下飞行的飞机了吗
So, do you have like a plane that goes underwater?

617
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,510
天上飞的船呢
Or like a boat that can fly?

618
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
你多大 40岁
How old are you, like 40?

619
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
喂 你话怎么这么多
Okay, you don't stop talking.

620
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,140
太不讨喜了
It's not charming.

621
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,930
既不中听 还让人心累
It's abrasive and exhausting.

622
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,890
我的天啊
And, oh, my God.

623
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,890
我才知道我原来这么讨人厌
I am starting to realize what people mean.

624
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,930
就当
Just...

625
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,390
帮我个忙
do me a favor

626
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,320
跟我保证 我们的见面不会破坏时空秩序
and promise me that meeting me isn't gonna screw up space-time.

627
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
好兄弟
Broski...

628
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
我保证
I got you.

629
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,280
糟了 这下我麻烦大了
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

630
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
什么意思
What do you mean?

631
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
怎么办
What do I do?

632
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
给你下药
I could drug you.

633
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,410
对 迷晕你
Yeah, I could drug you,

634
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,040
等你再醒来的时候
and then you'd pass out, you'd wake up

635
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,330
就会忘记这一切
and you'd forget that anything ever happened.

636
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,920
这么做没毛病吧 因为我们是同一人
And it wouldn't be wrong, right? Because you're me.

637
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,790
不行 我是说 不能这么做
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

638
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,710
拜托你不要
Please don't...

639
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,590
给我下药
drug me.

640
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,460
不行
No.

641
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,210
不行 因为我已经仔细想过了
No. Because here's the thing, and I thought about it before.

642
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
我可不想被下药
I don't want to be drugged.

643
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
但我们肯定还有别的办法
But I'm sure we can think of another way.

644
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,430
我们打开脑洞 好好想想
Let's put on our Barry thinking caps

645
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,300
肯定有别的办法
and think of a different solution

646
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,760
能让我失忆
for memory loss.

647
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,310
还有 我练过巴西战舞 已经绿带了
Also, I'm a green belt... in the capoeira,

648
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,520
我还仔细研究过格斗摔跤
and I have extensively studied wrestler,

649
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,150
你要真对我动手 肯定会吃大亏的
and I could just go frickin' lunatic on you.

650
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,570
何况 我今晚还有约会
Besides, I have a date tonight...

651
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
那好
Okay.

652
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,410
要多大力气才能把他打到失忆
How hard do you have to hit someone to make them forget stuff?

653
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,910
打过去的自己 未来的我会受伤吗
If I hit you in the past, will it hurt me in the future?

654
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,160
等等 你今晚有约会
Wait. You say you have a date tonight?

655
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,700
是啊 你刚刚想干什么
Yeah. Wait, what were you doing?

656
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,580
没什么
Uh, nothing.

657
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,710
跟谁约会
Who's your date with?

658
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,670
经济学课同班的一个大美女
This super babe in my econ class.

659
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,710
艾瑞斯韦斯特
Iris West?

660
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,960
老的天啊
Oh, my God!

661
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,050
我们会娶她
Do we marry her?

662
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,710
你今晚要去和她约会
You're going on a date with her tonight?

663
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,760
所以我回来让妈妈帮忙洗衣服
That's why I need Mom to do my laundry.

664
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,380
连自己的衣服都不洗
You don't even do your own laundry?

665
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,510
你呢
Do you?

666
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,050
好吧
Okay.

667
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,810
我真得走了
I'm actually gonna go.

668
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,680
你什么意思
What do you mean?

669
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,520
好好过日子 做自己
Enjoy your life. Do you.

670
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,020
什么都别改变
Change literally nothing.

671
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,390
走了 再也不见
Um, I'll see you again never.

672
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,150
可我还有几个问题
I have a few more questions, though.

673
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,270
我们还有很多事没弄清楚
We have so much to learn from each other.

674
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,530
真是的
Oh, great.

675
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,530
你要拍屁股走人
Well, you're leaving me.

676
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,900
雨把我的约会也毁了
And now the storm's gonna ruin my date.

677
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,030
今天是哪天
What day is it today?

678
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,790
星期天吧
Sunday?

679
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
不 日期
No, the date.

680
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,540
9月29日
It's September 29th.

681
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
该死
Shit.

682
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,460
这场暴风雨 就是这一天
This storm, this is the day.

683
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,090
哪一天
What day?

684
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,510
我获得超能力的那天
The day I got my powers.

685
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,890
你获得超能力的这天
The day you get your powers.

686
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,640
超能力
Powers?

687
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,510
听着
Listen...

688
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,390
我不能告诉你 我为什么回到过去
I can't tell you why I traveled back in time,

689
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,770
也不能告诉你 我改变了什么
and I can't tell you what I changed.

690
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,390
总之就是在我的时空里
But, essentially, in my version of reality,

691
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,810
我上大一时 在中心城的犯罪实验室实习
I ended up interning at the Central City Crime Lab in my freshman year,

692
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
就是在那里发生的
and that's where it happened.

693
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,650
将要发生
Well, happens.

694
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,030
就今晚 9月29日
Tonight, September 29,

695
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,900
那场意外给了我超能力
the accident that gives me my powers.

696
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,530
要是你没在那儿
And if you're not there...

697
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,820
只剩半小时了
in 30 minutes...

698
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,700
你就无法获得超能力
then you won't get the powers.

699
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,540
也就是说 我也有可能无法获取超能力
Which means I don't get the powers, maybe?

700
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,540
如果这样的话 我从一开始就不可能
And then, that would mean that I lose my way

701
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,290
穿越时空 回到过去
of getting back in time in the first place,

702
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,960
之后会发生什么 我就真的不知道了
and then I literally have no idea what happens.

703
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,670
超能力
Powers?

704
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,050
等等 那约会怎么办
Wait, but what about our date tonight?

705
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,760
她可能是我们未来的妻子啊
She might be our future wife.

706
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,560
要是你现在不跟我走的话
There might not be a future...

707
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,640
可能就没有未来了
if you don't come with me...

708
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,020
就现在
right now.

709
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,900
（中心城 研究中心）

710
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
还有八分钟
Eight minutes.

711
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,450
我们要怎么进去
How are we gonna to get inside?

712
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,530
你要干吗
What are you doing?

713
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,700
能少说两句吗
Would you stop whining?

714
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,410
接下来的感觉会有点儿怪
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

715
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,390
就这么穿过来了
We walk through the door.

716
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,690
没错 靠的是神速力共振
Yes, it's okay. It's called phasing.

717
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,770
走吧
Come on.

718
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,820
太过瘾了
I love phasing.

719
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,200
我们走 紧紧跟在我后面
Everybody moves.

720
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,770
好
Well...

721
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,140
就是这儿
this is it.

722
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,150
我当时就坐在这里
This is where I was sitting.

723
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,440
对了 来 我先帮你放一边
And actually, let me take this for you.

724
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
谢啦
Thank you.

725
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,400
我想想 当时 我打开的是那扇窗户
Okay, I had just opened those windows...

726
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,950
为的是给室内通通风
to clear out the fumes.

727
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,910
快到时间了
Right around now.

728
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,950
当时 我坐在这把椅子上
And I was sitting in that chair,

729
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,910
就坐在这排架子前面
and I was right under this shelf of chemicals.

730
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,660
然后 闪电就劈了进来
And that's when the lightning hits.

731
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,660
等等
Wait.

732
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,040
我会被闪电劈中
I get hit by lightning?

733
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
不 不 不
No, no, no.

734
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,920
你不会被闪电劈中
You don't get hit by lightning.

735
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,420
好吧 有一瞬间我还以为
Okay, 'cause for a second I thought you said...

736
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,920
闪电会劈中化学试剂
The lightning hits the chemicals...

737
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,460
然后把它们溅到你身上
which then you get bathed in,

738
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,590
导致你被电击
and that's what electrocutes you.

739
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,510
什么 我可不想被电死
Okay, but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.

740
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,380
坐好别动
Sit down.

741
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,300
该坐好的是你 我已经有超能力了
-No, you sit down. -I already have the powers!

742
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,510
你已经有超能力了
You already have the powers!

743
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,390
就是啊
Exactly!

744
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,930
我才不想被雷劈
I am not getting struck by lightning!

745
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
成功了
It worked.

746
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,320
你好像掉了一颗牙
It looks like you lost a tooth.

747
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,570
没有
No?

748
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,070
是你掉的
You lost a tooth.

749
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
（胶水）

750
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,670
好了 我们撤
All right. We gotta go.

751
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,300
出什么事了
What have we got?

752
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,430
无菌实验室的警报响了
The alarms in the sterile lab.

753
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
去检查一下
Go check it.

754
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,640
去门口守着
Securing the entrance.

755
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
得穿出去
We've gotta phase.

756
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,900
共振 共振
Phase, phasing.

757
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,030
该死
Shit!

758
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,660
我变慢了
I'm slow.

759
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,210
你这儿怎么比我想象的整洁那么多
Why is your place so much nicer than I expected it to be?

760
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,510
喜欢吗 妈妈帮着收拾的
You like it? Mom had to help decorate.

761
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,010
你是了解她的
You know Mom.

762
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,390
对 确实 她就这样
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

763
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,010
她就这样
Classic Mom.

764
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,900
今天可真刺激
What a day.

765
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,270
巴里 那场意外给了你超能力
Barry, the accident gave you powers,

766
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,820
也夺走了我的超能力
but took mine away.

767
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,570
所以我不知道该怎么回去了
So, I don't know how I get back.

768
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,280
如果用不了神速力
Without access to the Speed Force,

769
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,950
我都不知道该怎么离开这里
I don't know how I ever leave.

770
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,660
你明白我的意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying?

771
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,450
我可能被困住了
I might be stuck.

772
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
等一下
Wait.

773
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,410
我有超能力了
I have powers now?

774
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,670
对 但是
Yeah, but...

775
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,920
你 不不不
you... No, no, no.

776
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,140
这也太棒了
Holy speedballs.

777
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,560
听着 我知道你现在一定很激动
Okay, I know this is incredibly exciting,

778
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,020
因为我就是过来人 像飞毛腿冈萨雷斯一样
because I went through it. Speedy Gonzales!

779
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,400
是的 我自己也玩过很多次
Yes, I've done it many times myself.

780
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,900
但是你不能一上来就
You can't just start...

781
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
该死
Shit.

782
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,700
歌词大意 我们年轻
? We are young,

783
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,450
充满活力
we run green ?

784
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,950
保持牙齿
? Keep our teeth

785
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,530
干净整齐
Nice and clean ?

786
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,290
问亲访友
? See our friends

787
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,790
出游观光
See the sights ?

788
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,790
感觉挺好的
? And feel all right ?

789
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,790
弄点小钱
? Got some cash

790
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,340
买辆小车
Bought some wheels ?

791
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,050
开车出门
? Took it out

792
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,670
穿越原野
'Cross the fields ?

793
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,260
车子失控
? Lost control,

794
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,760
撞到墙上
hit a wall ?

795
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,760
我们挺好的
? But we're all right ?

796
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,190
我的天
Oh, my...

797
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,800
（坦纳烟花爆竹公司）

798
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,520
我马上走 我马上走
Okay, I'm leaving!

799
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,900
举起手来
Put your hands up.

800
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
你干什么了
What did you do?

801
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
没干什么
Nothing.

802
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,170
怎么了
Why?

803
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,140
巴里
Barry...

804
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,770
我刚才没跟你说衣服的事
I could've told you about the clothes.

805
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,640
摩擦生热
It's friction.

806
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,020
你跑得太快 普通衣服是会烧坏的
You run too fast, and regular fabrics are gonna burn up.

807
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,560
同理 不能在超光速状态下
It's the same reason why you can't

808
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,020
把人移得太远
move people very far at hyperspeed.

809
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,650
西兰花好像坏了
That broccoli looks rotten.

810
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,280
听好 有些东西是可以在超光速下移动的
Look, some things you can move.

811
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,650
比如 你可以移动
Like, you can move,

812
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,900
微波炉
for instance, a microwave.

813
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,700
有些就绝对不能移动 比如
But you can't move something like, say...

814
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,570
小宝宝
a baby.

815
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,910
巴里 我好像从来没吃过这么好的东西
Barry, it's like I've never eaten anything before.

816
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,660
味道特别 特别鲜活
Everything has this vivid flavor. Try a little.

817
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,790
尝一口 就一小口
Just take a little bite.

818
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,670
是不是很难吃
That's bad, isn't it?

819
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,670
当然很不好吃
Yeah, this is not good.

820
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,670
对 我逗你的
No, I was kidding.

821
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,670
我好厉害 我们都好厉害
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

822
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,550
我好饿
I'm so hungry.

823
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,670
等一下
Hey, wait.

824
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,180
我想试试那个共振
I wanna try that phasing thing.

825
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,260
那是怎么个振法
How do I do that?

826
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,760
先等等 没到时候呢 好吗
You don't. Not yet. Okay?

827
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,010
共振非常复杂
It's very complicated.

828
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,930
要练很长时间
Takes a long time

829
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,520
才能在身体整个加速的同时
to train your body to be able to speed up

830
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,390
让身上分子的振动速度放慢
whilst your molecules slow down enough to pass through

831
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,270
穿过固体的分子结构
the molecular structure of solid objects...

832
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,400
快给我滚出去
Get out of here!

833
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,330
你得先学会让我把话说完
You've gotta start letting me finish my sentences.

834
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,410
我们是一直这样又困 又饿
Are we always this sleepy? And hungry

835
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,670
还没衣服穿吗
and naked?

836
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,460
前两条 是的
Well, the first two, yes.

837
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,090
第三条 不是 我已经有办法了
The third one, no. I've figured that part out.

838
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,670
实话告诉你 如果教你这些
And honestly, if we're gonna do this

839
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,050
我有很多东西得跟你解释
there's a lot I'm gonna have to explain to you.

840
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,010
我觉得从这里开始讲比较好 就是
So, a good place to start, I guess, is that,

841
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,930
对 最初的战服
yeah, the original suit

842
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,390
是用一种复合材料制成
- was actually made out of this polysynth...

843
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,430
或者 那就
Or we'll

844
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,890
明天再继续说吧
pick this up tomorrow.

845
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,270
你是说 战服在戒指里
So, the suit is inside the ring?

846
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,150
对
Yeah.

847
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,520
真的
What?

848
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,520
这个是送我了吗
And I can have this?

849
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,070
不 不是送你
No, you can't have it.

850
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,030
是借给你
You can borrow it

851
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,320
免得你让自己的超能力害死
so you don't kill yourself using your powers.

852
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,150
（黑暗语）至尊戒 驭众戒

853
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
你按下这个按钮以后
You're gonna push this button

854
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,530
蚕丝分子会展开
and the silk molecules are gonna uncoil,

855
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,780
吸收大气中的气体
absorbing atmospheric gases

856
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,410
把战服完全撑开
and expanding the suit to full size.

857
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,450
准备好了吗
Ready?

858
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,390
它出来的时候可真小啊
It was so tiny...

859
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,520
你应该在它落地前就穿好它
You're supposed to put it on before it hits the floor.

860
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,560
我要 在你面前穿吗
What, like change... right here in front of you?

861
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,560
这附近根本就没有别人 巴里
There's no one even here anyway, Barry.

862
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,650
快点儿
Come on--

863
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,020
天啊
Whoo, man.

864
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,150
好紧
Tight.

865
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,150
有点疼
It hurts.

866
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:05,570
知道是哪儿疼吗
You know where it hurts?

867
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,450
那里疼
In my dick.

868
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,530
好了 我懂 我懂
Okay. I know, I know,

869
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,950
但我不想知道
but I don't need to know.

870
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,450
好了 我能继续了吗
Sorry, can we move on?

871
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,290
我是这么想的
Here's what I'm thinking.

872
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,580
只要我能教会你像我那样移动
If I can train you to move like I do,

873
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,210
我们就能重建时空之碗
then we can re-create the Chronobowl.

874
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,080
时空之碗
Chronobowl?

875
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,080
用神速力
In the Speed Force.

876
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,340
神速力
Speed Force?

877
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,340
这样 也许我就能找出办法 回到未来
And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.

878
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,420
《回到未来》
Back to the Future.

879
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,050
好看 艾瑞克斯托罗兹
Yes! Eric Stoltz

880
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,510
在里面演得特别好
is chur boy in that movie.

881
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,800
他把角色完全演活了
What an embodied performance.

882
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,140
是迈克尔J福克斯吧
You mean Michael J. Fox?

883
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
《回到未来》吗
Back to the Future?

884
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,680
对 就是电影《回到未来》 天啊
- Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future? -  -Oh, my God!

885
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,560
怎么回事 不知道
-What's going on? -I don't know.

886
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,030
你得先把战服脱了
You need to take the suit off now.

887
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,450
谢天谢地
Thank God.

888
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,290
目击者表示
...reported seeing a mysterious object

889
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,960
澳大利亚海岸上空悬停着一枚神秘物体
hovering above the Australian seaboard.

890
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,290
（突发新闻 神秘物体悬停于地面上空）

891
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,800
以下是本台取得的录像片段 佐德
-We've obtained footage from the sighting and as you can see, the object... -Zod.

892
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,300
“糟的”
"Zod"?

893
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,880
什么“糟的”
What's a zod?

894
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,510
美国政府官员称
According to US government officials,

895
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,390
基于卫星数据显示
satellite data

896
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,270
这是一艘宇宙飞船
has confirmed the presence of a spacecraft.

897
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,310
我们会跟进
We'll be sure--

898
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
你们可以叫我佐德将军
My name is General Zod.

899
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,820
我的星球离地球非常遥远
I come from a world far from yours.

900
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,650
你们的星球长久以来
For some time, your world

901
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,200
庇护了我们的一位公民 糟了
-has sheltered one of my citizens. -No, no, no.

902
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,330
我要求你们立刻 这不可能
-This can't be happening. -I request that you return this individual...

903
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,080
把这个人送回来交给我看管 偏偏在这个时候
- Not now. - ...to my custody.

904
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,790
出什么事了
What's happening?

905
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,330
佐德在找超人
Zod's looking for Superman.

906
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,960
什么超人
What's a superman?

907
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
超人是生活在地球上的外星人
Superman is an alien who lives on Earth.

908
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,050
我猜他还在隐藏身份
I'm assuming still incognito.

909
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,640
不过 他是外星人
But, yeah, he's an alien,

910
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,430
非常非常厉害
and he's very powerful,

911
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,060
人也特别好
and he's just the best.

912
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,270
佐德和超人来自同一个星球
And then Zod is an alien from the same planet,

913
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,520
他也很厉害
also very powerful,

914
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,060
但他是个大坏蛋
but he's just the worst.

915
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,770
而当时 佐德就是来找克拉克的
And Zod came here to find Clark.

916
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,150
等等 克拉克又是谁
Wait, who's Clark?

917
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,900
克拉克就是超人
Clark is Superman.

918
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,280
好的
Oh. Okay.

919
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,650
然后 佐德
But then Zod

920
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,660
还想用他的创世引擎彻底改造地球的生态
also tried to terraform the planet with this World Engine thing,

921
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,160
最后超人阻止了他 可是在那之前
and Superman stopped him eventually,

922
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,160
佐德已经杀死了好多好多人
but not before Zod killed thousands of people.

923
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,330
天啊 在那个时候
-Yeesh. -And at the time,

924
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,920
我什么都做不了 我
there was nothing I could do, I've...

925
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,590
等等
Wait, you...

926
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,420
你 你当时在场
You were there?

927
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,300
对 当时我刚刚获得超能力
Yeah, I had just gotten my powers.

928
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,180
还在对战服做最后的修改
And I was still putting some finishing touches on my suit.

929
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,640
佐德的创世引擎
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

930
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,440
当时已经开始摧毁大都会了
it started destroying Metropolis,

931
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,400
所以我就赶了过去
so I just went there

932
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,270
想要救人
and I started trying to save people.

933
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
爸爸
Daddy?

934
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,910
听话 快跑啊
Listen to me! Run away!

935
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,410
快跑啊
Run away!

936
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,330
那个孩子
There was this kid, and I...

937
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,960
我救了他 可
I got him, but then...

938
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,790
我没法再救他爸爸
I couldn't get his dad.

939
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,670
爸爸
Daddy!

940
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,770
当年 我只有能力救那个孩子
It was all I could do, save that one kid.

941
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,650
只有超人能够阻止佐德
Only Superman could stop Zod.

942
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,820
可他也没来得及救那些人
But not in time to save those people.

943
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,910
现在 同样的事情又要重演了
And now it's about to happen again.

944
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,530
不过
But...

945
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,080
如果我能集结整个正义联盟
if I can find the entire Justice League,

946
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,330
就是超人和其他的英雄
Superman and the rest of the band...

947
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,540
对
Right.

948
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,300
也许我就能阻止这些事情的发生
...then maybe I can prevent the whole thing from ever even happening at all.

949
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,380
把你的电脑给我
Um, give me your laptop.

950
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,430
好的
Okay.

951
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,510
什么味道
What is that smell?

952
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,510
有味道的东西多了
Could be anything.

953
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
真的
Honestly.

954
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,520
那是谁
Who's that?

955
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,020
那是加里
That's Gary.

956
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,440
是他身上的味道
That's the smell. It's...

957
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,060
没事 他这人就是很随意
Don't worry. He's breezy.

958
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,900
一定能查到的
We can do this.

959

1010
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,700
是啊
Yes.

1011
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,710
您在灯塔工作
And you work at a lighthouse?

1012
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,580
是啊
Yes.

1013
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,790
好的 您爱人是
Okay, and your wife

1014
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,040
亚特兰蒂斯女王吗
is the queen of Atlantis?

1015
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
不是
Uh, no.

1016
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,010
好 或者说 她是不是一位
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

1017
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,050
像鱼一样的女士
um, a fishlike woman

1018
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,930
有一天搁浅在了岸边
washed into your life

1019
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,640
进入了你的生活呢
at some point or another?

1020
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,020
你可真幽默 混球
Very funny, asshole.

1021
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,150
亚瑟库瑞根本没出生
Arthur Curry was never born.

1022
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,270
什么
What?

1023
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:14,900
简直是一场灾难 我
This is a disaster. I-I-

1024
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,190
彻底扰乱了历史
I completely destroyed history.

1025
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,320
就像艾瑞克斯托罗兹
Like Eric Stoltz.

1026
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,190
我说 你怎么老提这个人的名字
Okay, why do you keep saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

1027
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,650
他演了马蒂麦克弗莱
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

1028
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,530
什么
What?

1029
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,570
时间旅行
Time travel?

1030
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,450
你们在聊《回到未来》
We talking "BTTF"?

1031
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,530
喂 这人到底是谁
Come on, who is this guy?

1032
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,410
不是 我知道
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

1033
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,080
我把《回到未来》全看了
I've seen all of them

1034
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,580
马蒂麦克弗莱不是艾瑞克斯托罗兹演的
and Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly.

1035
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
是吗
Really?

1036
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,420
那这个麦克“股”莱怎么解释
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

1037
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,800
没法跟你解释 加里
I can't explain that to you, Gary.

1038
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,090
那儿可不是“股”
That's not your thigh.

1039
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,130
演员也纹错了 还上下颠倒了
It's the wrong actor, and it's upside down.

1040
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,380
是吗
Is it?

1041
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,890
可重点在于
The point is that

1042
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,520
在《回到未来》里
in Back to the Future

1043
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
大家都知道 演这个角色的人
Marty McFly is very famously played

1044
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,060
是迈克尔J福克斯
by Michael J. Fox.

1045
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,060
演《浑身是劲》的那个
The guy from Footloose?

1046
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,650
错 那是凯文培根
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

1047
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:57,520
培根
Bacon.

1048
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,440
培根演了独行侠
Kevin Bacon's Maverick

1049
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,400
打排球 秀肌肉 开飞机的那个
with the volleyball, the gay guys, and the planes?

1050
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,280
《壮志凌云》
Top Gun.

1051
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,950
“熊熊的烈火” 《壮志凌云》
? Great balls of fire! ? Top Gun, right?

1052
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,280
完了 完了 对吧
No, no, no.

1053
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,910
我把整个宇宙都给搅乱了
I completely broke the universe.

1054
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,910
斯托罗兹演了麦克弗莱
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

1055
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,790
对了
Yes.

1056
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:12,910
谢了
Thank you.

1057
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,290
我制造了一个没有超人类的世界
I created a world with no metahumans.

1058
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,460
这下没人帮我们抵挡佐德了
And now there's no one to defend us from Zod.

1059
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
阿尔伯特
Albert!

1060
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,300
这里没有钢骨
There's no Cyborg.

1061
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,510
也没有海王 没有神奇女侠
There's no Aquaman. There's no Wonder Woman.

1062
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,760
没有超人
There's no Superman.

1063
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,010
没有蝙蝠侠
There's no Batman.

1064
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,260
我是蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

1065
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,020
你 你刚才说什么来着
What, you... What did you just say?

1066
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,190
我是蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

1067
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,570
这儿有蝙蝠侠
Batman exists?

1068
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,440
当然了
Hundo p.

1069
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,780
是啊 兄弟 没人知道他的真实身份
Yeah, dude. Nobody knows who he really is,

1070
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,280
不过 是有这么个人
but he exists.

1071
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
好
Right.

1072
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,200
好吧 我们
Well, uh, we...

1073
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,160
我和巴里表弟
my cousin Barry and I,

1074
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,540
要去另一位表哥家吃饭了
have to go to that cousin's dinner.

1075
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
现在就得走
Now.

1076
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:57,040
不过还是很高兴认识大家
But it was a pleasure to meet you all.

1077
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,080
再见 加里
And Gary. Barry.

1078
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,170
再见 巴里
Gary. Barry.

1079
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,170
再见 巴里
-Barry. -Gary.

1080
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,050
再见 加里
Gary. Barry.

1081
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,170
巴里
Barry!

1082
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,530
你是在逗我吧 这是什么鬼地方
What, are you frickin' kidding me with this place?

1083
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,780
这是哪儿 地狱吗
What is this, hell?

1084
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:40,210
门没关
It's open.

1085
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,140
快看 这些东西好酷
Look at all this cool shit!

1086
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,390
行了 巴里 不要碰这里的东西
Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

1087
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
有人吗
Hello?

1088
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,020
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1089
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,950
布鲁斯 你在吗
Bruce, are you there?

1090
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
好家伙
Oh, boy.

1091
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,830
我都不知道你会画画
Hey, I didn't know you painted.

1092
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,660
画得挺好
They're good.

1093
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,710
布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne?

1094
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,010
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1095
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:44,900
你看这里
Hey, check this out.

1096
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,150
这些铃铛连着这里的各个房间
There's, like, bells connected to every room in this house.

1097
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,530
没准我们摇摇铃
Hey, maybe we can find this Bruce guy...

1098
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,450
就能找到这位布鲁斯 你说呢
if we just ring all these bells, right?

1099
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,780
你不知道仆人铃怎么用吗
You don't understand how servant bells work?

1100
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,450
是其他房间里的人摇铃召唤这里的人
You ring them from all the other places.

1101
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,330
是吗
What?

1102
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,540
你们这边没有《唐顿庄园》吗
You don't have, like, Downton Abbey in your universe?

1103
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,040
“糖炖庄园”
Downtown Abbey's?

1104
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,290
你说那个连锁家常菜馆啊
The chain of, like, family-style restaurants?

1105
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,420
就是个价位低一些的香蕉蜂
They're like, it's like cheaper Bananabee's.

1106
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,300
知道我现在特想吃什么吗
Oh, you know what I'd really go for right now?

1107
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,720
糖炖家的焦香西葫芦块
Abbey's sizzlin' zucchini squares.

1108
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,890
行吧
Okay.

1109
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,040
你有完没完
You know what, man?

1110
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,580
真是受够你了
I've had it with you.

1111
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,640
好了 暂停

1112
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,310
什么啊

1113
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,410
你是什么人
Who the hell are you?

1114
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,540
我是这儿的主人
I'm the guy who lives here.

1115
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,460
我们在找布鲁斯韦恩
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

1116
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
你们饿吗
You hungry?

1117
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,170
佐德将军播报后
...following the broadcast earlier from General Zod.

1118
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,550
（重要新闻 外星人播报引发公众恐慌）

1119
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,340
他们寻找的目标依然没有音讯
The individual they're searching for is still at large.

1120
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,420
所以说
So...

1121
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,760
你和他是同一个人
...you're the same person as him...

1122
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,270
但你来自另一条时间线
but from an alternate timeline.

1123
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,310
是的
Yes.

1124
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:43,770
在你那边
In which...

1125
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,770
我们是好朋友
you and I are friends?

1126
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,020
对 你可能
Yeah, you're like

1127
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,190
是我最好的朋友
probably my best friend.

1128
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,400
好吧
Okay.

1129
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,070
但是你有点 你
Well, but you're a bit... you're, uh...

1130
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,070
你的岁数有些 变化
chronologically different.

1131
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,950
老了
Older.

1132
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,910
这也正是我弄不明白的地方
That's what I can't understand.

1133
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,450
我回到了过去 从这里回到这里
I traveled back in time from here to here.

1134
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,330
结果不知道为什么 我回到了
Yet somehow, everything's all changed

1135
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,540
这里
back here.

1136
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,330
或者是你出生的时候
Or like when you were born, so...

1137
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,210
时间不是线性的 对吧
Well... time isn't linear. Right?

1138
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,550
对
Right.

1139
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,510
你可能
At some point

1140
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,640
在电影里看到过这样的内容
you probably saw a movie that told you

1141
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,060
如果你回到过去 改变了历史
that if you went back and changed the past,

1142
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,390
就会创造出一条时间线分支 对不对
you'd create a kind of a branched timeline, right?

1143
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,690
你看
Like, look.

1144
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,900
新的当下
New present

1145
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,780
新的未来
and new future.

1146
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,650
对
Yeah.

1147
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,320
时间不是这么运转的
Well, time doesn't work like that.

1148
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,910
不是这个原理
That's not how time works.

1149
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,530
你穿越回去 改变历史 就会创造出
When you go back and change the past

1150
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,780
一个支点
you create a fulcrum.

1151
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,080
你来到了一根新的意面上
You put yourself on a whole nother strand of spaghetti.

1152
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,330
新的未来
New future.

1153
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,710
新的过去
New past.

1154
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,420
这是逆因果
It's retrocausal.

1155
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,960
可以有两种走向
It goes both ways.

1156
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,670
实际上 是有很多种走向
Actually, it goes many ways.

1157
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,590
下次再说吧
Maybe some other time.

1158
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,260
好吧 但是在本体论悖论模型里 并没有
Okay, but in an ontological paradox model, there's not...

1159
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,260
你这样做 不但改变了未来
What you did was you changed the future

1160
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,270
也改变了过去
and you changed the past.

1161
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,940
倘若有人真的蠢到了家
If a person is stupid enough

1162
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,440
扰乱了时间秩序
to mess with time...

1163
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,320
最后就会导致
what you eventually end up with

1164
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,520
这样的结果
is this.

1165
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,280
多重宇宙
The multiverse.

1166
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:20,160
有些时间线近乎平行
Some strands run almost parallel.

1167
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,700
它们之间难免会有交汇点
There will be inevitable intersections,

1168
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,790
其他时间线就会
and others that are just...

1169
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,540
发散得很厉害
wildly divergent.

1170
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
总之就是
What it is...

1171
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:30,420
一团糟
is a hot mess.

1172
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,040
就像掷骰子
It's a crapshoot.

1173
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,050
完全没有规律可言
It's all just a crapshoot.

1174
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,170
那干酪又代表什么
What does the parmesan mean?

1175
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,170
他打完比方了 就是弄点装饰
The metaphor's over. It's just a garnish.

1176
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,300
我就这么说吧
And I'll tell ya something.

1177
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,390
只有那种特别特别蠢的人
A person would have to be an idiot

1178
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,140
才会扰乱
to play craps

1179
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,270
时空连续统
with the space-time continuum.

1180
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,140
对 蠢
Yeah, an idiot.

1181
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,900
给
Here.

1182
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,150
你吃饭怎么会闹出这么大的动静
Are you joking with the chewing noises right now?

1183
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
所以说
So, uh,

1184
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,280
是因为你
you're the reason

1185
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,450
这个叫佐德的家伙
this Zod character

1186
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,950
才要毁灭地球
is about to destroy the Earth?

1187
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,410
有可能
Maybe.

1188
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,540
还有个叫超人的家伙
There's a guy called Superman

1189
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,660
可以阻止佐德
who can stop Zod?

1190
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,580
对 对
Yeah, yeah.

1191
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:11,830
他还会飞
And flies?

1192
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,670
还长着镭射眼
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1193
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,540
没错 他会飞
Yes, he flies,

1194
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,090
还长着镭射眼 没错
and he shoots lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1195
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,840
没人觉得超人这名号
No one said "Superman"...

1196
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,760
有点太刻意了吗
that might be a little on the nose?

1197
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,930
那你还管自己叫蝙蝠侠呢
You call yourself Batman.

1198
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,510
是啊 我又没管自己叫
Yeah. I don't call myself

1199
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,640
超级蝙蝠侠
Super Batman.

1200
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,770
等等 他是蝙蝠侠吗
Wait, he's Batman?

1201
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,640
不然我们干吗到这里来
What did you think we were doing here?

1202
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,150
我还以为是来表哥家里吃饭呢
I thought this was the cousin's dinner.

1203
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,440
他 布鲁斯韦恩是蝙蝠侠
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1204
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,400
现在也不完全是
Not really. Not so much anymore.

1205
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,150
知道吗
You know...

1206
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,650
人们不需要我了
they don't really need me.

1207
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,820
时过境迁
Things have changed.

1208
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:47,790
哥谭现在是全球最安全的城市之一
Gotham's now one of the safest cities in the world.

1209
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,540
可我需要你
Well, I... I need you.

1210
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,460
我们需要你
We need you.

1211
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,540
在我那边
In my timeline,

1212
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,790
蝙蝠侠是我们的军师和领袖
Batman's our strategist, our leader.

1213
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,170
这个世界需要超人
The world needs Superman.

1214
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,460
而你是最好的侦探
You're the best detective in the world.

1215
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,550
也许只有你才能帮我们找到他
You're probably the only person who can help me find him.

1216
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,300
那么 你愿意帮我们吗
So, will you help us?

1217
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,590
不愿意
Pass.

1218
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,390
你是让我

1219
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,520
把盐递过去吗
Like pass the salt?

1220
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,140
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1221
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,520
既然他不想帮忙
He doesn't want to help us...

1222
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,440
我们就用他的蝙蝠设备自己查
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1223
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,900
蝙蝠设备
Bat shit?

1224
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,280
对 蝙蝠侠的各种高级设备
Yeah, his bat stuff, his bat things.

1225
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,650
你先站上去
Stand on that thing.

1226
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
好了 记得你共振穿地板那次吗
Okay, remember when you phased through the floor?

1227
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,700
记得
Yeah.

1228
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,700
好 现在你得再来一次
So, I need you to do that again.

1229
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,300
这是什么地方
What is this place?

1230
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,410
天啊
Dude!

1231
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,790
这个地方真是爆炫
This place straight beeves!

1232
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:54,830
爆炫
"Beeves"?

1233
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,170
巴里
Barry!

1234
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,550
我差点摔死在
I almost died

1235
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,640
万丈深渊里
in an abyss!

1236
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,010
美国有12805个叫克拉克肯特的人
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1237
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,180
（搜索结果 克拉克肯特 12805条搜索结果）

1238
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,140
这难道是我想的那样东西吗
Is this what I think it is?

1239
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,780
我的天
Holy shit!

1240
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,070
这是我小的时候
I used to see

1241
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,200
在电视新闻上见过的玩意
this thing on the news when I was a kid!

1242
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,280
好的
Okay, well...

1243
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,790
缩小范围
refine search.

1244
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,080
出生日期
Date of birth.

1245
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,460
他不是在地球上出生的 是从外星来的
Wasn't born. He arrived.

1246
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,540
巴里 快看
Oh, Barry, look!

1247
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:41,710
我忙着呢
I'm busy.

1248
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,960
忙什么啊
With what?

1249
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,090
我在查过去这50年里
Looking for unidentified objects entering Earth's atmosphere

1250
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,970
从堪萨斯附近领空 进入地球大气层的不明地外物体
anywhere near Kansas in the last 50 years.

1251
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,800
他这里能进入国家航天局系统
He has a back door into NASA.

1252
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:53,560
不愧是他
'Course he does.

1253
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
不过 巴里
Yeah, but Barry,

1254
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,140
你看看这个嘛
check this out.

1255
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,060
这个小袋子会笑
This bag laughs.

1256
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,690
行了 你能不能忙点正事
Okay, can't you take anything seriously?

1257
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,270
别再瞎闹了
Stop messing around.

1258
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,020
哥们 拜托
Dude, come on.

1259
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,440
你在这里四处转过没有
Have you seen this place?

1260
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,780
真的太酷了
It's amazing!

1261
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,820
喂
Hello!

1262
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,910
你现在还不知道事态有多严重吗
Has the gravity of this not sunk in for you?

1263
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,410
别再瞎闹了 巴里
Stop messing around, Barry.

1264
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,790
这是最后一次警告
I won't say it again.

1265
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,080
真是
Yeesh.

1266
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,660
抱歉 老妈
Sorry, Mom.

1267
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,710
闭嘴
Shut up.

1268
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,790
闭嘴
Shut up.

1269
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,790
你根本不知道自己有多幸运
You have no idea how lucky you are.

1270
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,040
根本不知道
No idea!

1271
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,550
你觉得一切都是理所当然的
You take everything for granted.

1272
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,090
根本不懂得感恩
You don't even appreciate...

1273
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:28,670
一天到晚瞎晃
You just walk around thinking

1274
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,510
以为自己可幽默 可时髦了
that you're so funny and so cool.

1275
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,890
真丢人
And it's embarrassing,

1276
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,010
因为其实
because

1277
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,310
你哪条都不沾
you're not any of those things!

1278
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,270
你少来好吗
Hey, screw you, man!

1279
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,690
我干的全是你让我干的事
I've done nothing but everything you've asked.

1280
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,400
你还害得我被闪电劈
You made me get struck by lightning!

1281
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,940
我光着身子穿过了地板
I phased naked through the floor.

1282
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,520
把约翰森夫人吓了个半死
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

1283
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,270
没准我还得搬走
Now I'm probably gonna have to move.

1284
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,440
你甚至都没告诉我你为什么会来这里
You won't even tell me why you're here.

1285
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,940
那你能不能告诉我 为什么
But will you at least tell me why

1286
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,660
无缘无故对我这么苛刻
you're being so mean to me... for no reason?

1287
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,160
你把小猴子当成飞镖靶子
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1288
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:58,330
等等 什么
Wait, what?

1289
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,160
算了
Forget it.

1290
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:03,920
小猴子 等等
The monkey? Wait...

1291
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,960
你跟我发这么大火 就因为
So, you're mad at me

1292
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,800
我玩了一个玩具
for playing with a toy?

1293
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,090
那不是普通玩具
It's not a toy.

1294
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,300
是妈妈买给我们的
Mom bought us that monkey.

1295
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,890
因为她就叫我们小猴子
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1296
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,140
还总是送我们和猴子有关的东西
She gives us monkey stuff all the time.

1297
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,890
好吧
Right.

1298
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,890
那个
Look...

1299
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:21,890
对不起
I'm sorry.

1300
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,690
我不太会和人相处
I'm not very good with people.

1301
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,520
包括我自己
Even myself.

1302
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,570
没事 哥们
Come on, dude.

1303
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,030
你其实还好啦
You're... You're not that bad.

1304
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,570
就是有的时候烦人了一点儿 但是
You can just be kind of a dick sometimes.

1305
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
说实话 我这人是挺招人讨厌的
But let's face it. I am pretty obnoxious.

1306
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,410
我特别容易激动
But I just get excited.

1307
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,790
好啦 这地方真挺棒的 你说呢
Come on. This place is pretty cool, right?

1308
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:45,290
是啊
Yeah.

1309
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,840
那我
All right, well, um...

1310
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:52,670
不打扰你了
I'll let you work.

1311
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,900
我知道你在
I know you're there.

1312
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,160
知道我在想什么吗
You know what I'm stuck on?

1313
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,910
在想你用意面打的那个比方
That thing you said, with the spaghetti.

1314
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,700
你当时说 有些时空之间的交汇
You said there were certain intersections

1315
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,290
是避免不了的
that would always be inevitable.

1316
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,080
（赠布鲁斯韦恩 你的朋友 阿尔弗雷德）

1317
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,580
阿尔弗雷德当过你的助手
You had an Alfred.

1318
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,290
在我那边 他也是蝙蝠侠的助手
My Bruce has an Alfred.

1319
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,670
世界不一样 时间也不一样
Different worlds, different times...

1320
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
但是你看
yet there it is.

1321
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,840
有一些人
Certain people,

1322
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,180
有一些事
certain events,

1323
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,890
有些意大利面
certain strands of spaghetti,

1324
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,640
会像磁铁一样相互吸引
drawn to each other like... like magnets.

1325
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,890
我看了大量
I've read all about

1326
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,400
时间悖论和因果循环的资料 但是
temporal paradoxes and causal loops. But

1327
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,900
事实比理论复杂
this is more than that.

1328
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,940
时间线之间那些不可避免的交汇点
Inevitable intersections

1329
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,650
是任何理论都没法预测到的
are something none of the theories could have anticipated 'cause,

1330
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,780
因为 还能怎么解释呢 只能说是
well, how do you explain that except for...

1331
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,530
命运的安排
fate?

1332
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,660
你还在听吗
If you are listening,

1333
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,660
你父母的事我很遗憾
sorry about your parents.

1334
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,920
我也只是想救我的父母
I'm just trying to save mine.

1335
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,290
一定会有办法的
There has to be a way.

1336
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,170
一定会有办法的 巴里
There is a way, Barry.

1337
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,590
继续 继续
Just keep trying. Keep trying, Barry.

1338
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
他找到超人了
Found him.

1339
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,890
巴里 你快醒醒
Barry, wake up.

1340
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,430
克拉克被雇佣兵组织
Clark's being held by a mercenary group

1341
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,060
关在西伯利亚的秘密基地里
in a Siberian black site.

1342
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,640
快起来 巴里
Get up, Barry.

1343
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,890
山羊身上着火了
The goat's on fire.

1344
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:10,900
我们得去趟俄罗斯
We're going to Russia.

1345
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:13,940
真好
Sweet.

1346
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,150
有咖啡
Mm. Coffee.

1347
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,700
我们怎么去俄罗斯
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1348
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,150
我会帮你们找到超人
I'll help you get this Superman.

1349
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,160
然后 就要靠你们自己了
Then, you're on your own.

1350
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
你
Oh!

1351
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,330
你是
You're...

1352
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,410
你是
You are, you're...

1353
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,790
没错
Yeah.

1354
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,960
我是蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

1355
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,680
计划是什么
So, what's the plan?

1356
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,640
直接进去 拉上超人
We're just gonna, what, grab Superman

1357
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,140
在敌人发现之前跑掉
and dip set before the block is hot?

1358
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,180
不知道
I don't know.

1359
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,690
你问问他
Hey, you should ask him.

1360
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:15,690
你去问他
You ask him.

1361
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,560
你去问他
You should ask him.

1362
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,440
好啊
Yeah,

1363
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,310
我可不问
I'm not gonna ask him.

1364
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,900
为什么 我还以为他是你好朋友
Why not? I thought Batman was supposed to be your friend.

1365
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,690
又不是他 不是这个蝙蝠侠
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1366
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,570
我们到了
We're here.

01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:39,290
好吧 弹射还分步骤
Okay, there are stages.

1372
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,050
你们身后都备了降落伞
You're strapped to your parachutes.

1373
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,890
你的伞呢
Hey, where's yours?

1374
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,150
这也太酷啦
This rips dicks!

1375
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,790
一切正常 我们走
All clear. Let's move.

1376
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,140

Okay!

1377

行 你们速度都快 就我慢

1378
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,570
怎么这么冷
Why is it so cold? - It's the Arctic, Barry.

1379
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,030
这里是北极 巴里

1380
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:55,660
他人呢
Where'd he go?

1381
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,410
不知道 跟着脚印走就是了
I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1382
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,340
超人肯定就在下面
Superman would be down there for sure.

1383
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,670
（俄语）有人闯进来了 快通知守卫

1384

你干什么了
What did you do?

1388
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,540
我移动了你 不过
I had to move you. But

1389
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,660
没动多少
I just did it a little.

1390
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,540
（俄语）找到了 在这儿

1391

01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,050
（俄语）集中火力

1393
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,890
吐出来就好了
Just let it out.

1394
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,580
（俄语）我的天啊

1395
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,760
走吧
Let's go.

1396
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,190
超人就被关在这里
That's where you keep Superman.

1397
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,070
像一颗大铁蛋
Like a big scrotum.

1398
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:37,660
（拒绝访问）

1399
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,790
他要用这台翻盖手机黑进苏联的网络安全系统
He's gonna hack the Soviet security cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1400
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,210
（允许访问）

1401
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,920
我把所有密码都试了一遍
I tried all the combinations.

1402
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,920
成了
Yes!

1403
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,260
该死
Shit.

1404
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,390
卡尔-艾尔
Kal-El?

1405
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,270
不是他
It's not him.

1406
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,430
我们得走了
We've gotta go.

1407
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,520
等等
Wait.

1408
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,310
不能丢下她 她都这样了
We can't just leave her here. Look at her.

1409
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,570
我来抱她 快走
I'll grab her. Just go!

1410
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,660
有我在呢
I got you.

1411
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,050
我来收拾这个蠢货
I'll handle this jabroni.

1412
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,770
什么
What the...

1413
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,150
巴里
Barry!

1414
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,320
我中弹了
Somebody shot me!

1415
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,700
我们得赶紧跑
Time to dip set!

1416
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,800
（俄语）快把人放下
You, you lead the way!

1417
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,550
不 别推我 别往下推
-Go! -Not that way! Not that way!

1418
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,560
（俄语）把人放下 不然我就开枪了

1419
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,520
天啊
Oh, God!

1420
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:13,150
隐蔽
Cover!

1421
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,290
要掉下来了 要下来了
It's coming around.

1422
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,210
快啊 快啊
Hurry, hurry.

1423
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,920
（俄语）集中火力射击线缆

1424
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,840
不 别推我
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1425
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,760
该死

1426
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,810
不
No!

1427
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,020

快走
Let's go.

1429
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,400
你根本没告诉我会中枪
You didn't tell me we could get shot!

1430
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,650
你凭什么觉得我们不会中枪
Why would you assume we couldn't?

1431
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,280
（俄语）跟上 跟上 跟上

1432
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:15,920
好极了 我要死在苏联卫星脚下了
Oh, great! To die at the feet of a Sputnik.

1433
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,670
大哥 我这膝盖还得用呢
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1434
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,930
淡定 会自愈的
Stay calm. It'll heal.

1435
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,800
快点儿
Come on.

1436
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,010
不

1437
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,060
（充能级别）

1438
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,570
你体重多少公斤

（俄语）把人交出来 不然我就开枪了

1443
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,700
抓稳了
Hold on.

1444
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,400
（俄语）不许动

1445
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,520
该死 他们追上来了 这边也来人了
Oh, great. They're here. They're over here, too.

1446
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,190
斯米诺冰纯 对 斯米诺冰纯
Smirnoff Ice. Yes. Smirnoff Ice.

1447
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,280
他们动真格了 巴里 闭嘴
Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1448
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,320
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1449
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,450
怎么办
What's the play?

1450
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,160
蝙蝠侠 我们现在怎么办
Batman, what do we do? What now?

1451
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,410
现在
Now...

1452
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,790
我们得先保命
we try not to die.

1453
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,050
（俄语）你要干什么

1454
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,180
（俄语）射击

1455
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,140
（俄语）射击

1456
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,190
刚才那些要是有慢镜头就好了
Oh, you guys should've seen that in slo-mo.

1457
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,560
我才意识到这么做有点儿欠考虑了
Yeah, I'm just realizing that I didn't really think this through.

1458
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,690
虽然氪星有好人
There are good Kryptonians...

1459
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,810
但那里同样也不缺十恶不赦的坏蛋
and then there are very, very bad Kryptonians.

1460
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:25,690
（重要新闻 外星飞船出现在美国空军基地上空）

1461
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,280
我当时信心十足地认为我们能在那里找到超人
And I was very confident that we were just gonna find Superman,

1462
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,190
如果我们真的找到了超人
and if we found Superman,

1463
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,070
那这一切就都迎刃而解了
then this would all be super simple.

1464
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,820
你们是谁 我的天啊
- Who are you? - Holy Funyuns.

1465
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,780
（危险罪犯）

1466
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:36,830
你好
Hi.

1467
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,910
我是巴里 我俩都是
-I... I'm Barry. -We're Barry.

1468
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,920
我们本来要找卡尔-艾尔
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1469
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,830
但最后我们只找到了你
But we found you instead.

1470
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,170
你们找卡尔-艾尔干什么
What do you want with Kal-El?

1471
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,050
我们想救他出来
We were trying to rescue him.

1472
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:48,090
为什么
Why?

1473
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,920
因为他是我朋友
Because he's my friend.

1474
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,970
你认识他吗
Do you... Do you know him?

1475
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,890
她好像火了 准备好
She looks mad. Get ready.

1476
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:57,640
她会使用镭射眼 还会吹超级冷的冻气
She might do laser vision, or she might do, like, a freezy breath...

1477
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,430
也可能直接乱扔东西
or she'll just start throwing crazy...

1478
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,680
我的名字叫卡拉
My name is Kara.

1479
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:02,640
佐-艾尔之女
Daughter of Zor-El.

1480
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:04,770
卡尔-艾尔是我堂弟
Kal-El was my cousin.

1481
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,520
等等 卡尔-艾尔是谁来着
Right, and who's Kal-El again?

1482
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,400
就是超人
It's Superman.

1483
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,030
不 你之前说他叫克拉克
No, 'cause you said that was Clark.

1484
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,150
克拉克是谁
Who's Clark?

1485
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,530
克拉克 是他在地球的名字
Clark is his human name.

1486
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,410
克拉克
Clark.

1487
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,290
我们离开家时他还是个婴儿
He was an infant when we left.

1488
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:22,580
最后的氪星之子 而我
The last son of Krypton... I...

1489
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,920
我奉命保护他
I was sent to protect him.

1490
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:29,210
看样子在这个宇宙中他根本没有来到地球
It looks like he never made it to Earth in this universe.

1491
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,220
我们两个的救生艇肯定是分开了
Our pods, they must have separated.

1492
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,050
等等 你觉得一个小婴儿
Wait, so you thought a baby

1493
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,510
可以帮我们对抗这个叫佐德的家伙
was gonna protect us from this Zod guy?

1494
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,140
佐德将军到这儿来了
General Zod is here.

1495
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,010
肯定是追踪救生艇的信号来的
He must have tracked my pod's signal.

1496
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:41,560
我得走了
I have to go.

1497
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,770
等会儿
Whoa, whoa, wait.

1498
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,560
那个 你需要恢复一下体力
Well, you need to recover your strength.

1499
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,020
这样 巴里
Actually, Barry...

1500
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,690
你带她去屋顶
take her to the roof

1501
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,520
让她在阳光下晒一会儿
and put her in the sun.

1502
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900
好
Yeah.

1503
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:52,900
对 这完全没有问题
-Yeah. -Whatever, like if, I mean,

1504
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,650
你可以用阳光充能
you're solar powered.

1505
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,280
真了不起 我一直试着
Good for you. I've been trying to...

1506
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,540
我帮你拿着
We'll take that with us.

1507
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,710
我现在能
Um, am I cool to...

1508
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,300
转过去了吗
turn around?

1509
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,140
你现在穿的是
Are you dressed

1510
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,260
红色披风
in a red cape?

1511
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,520
你还能悬空
You're levitating?

1512
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,530
这里一直这么吵吗
Is it always this loud?

1513
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,950
这里很吵吗
Is it loud?

1514
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,410
你感觉怎么样 体力有没有
Are you, uh, good? Do you feel, um...

1515
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,910
恢复一点儿
strong yet, or...

1516
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:54,090
很好 看起来就很强大
Yep, that seems, uh,

1517
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,090
那什么
seems strong. You know...

1518
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,430
刚才下边那个老巴里
old man Barry, down there,

1519
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,890
他说如果我们不去阻止佐德队长
says if we don't stop Captain Zode,

1520
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,140
他会害死成千上万的人
he'll kill thousands of people.

1521
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,640
是数十亿人
Billions of people.

1522
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,140
数十亿吗
Billions?

1523
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,640
地球上的人
Of your people.

1524
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:08,520
他们是好人
They're good people.

1525
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,690
好人
Good people?

1526
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,400
我们来到这个星球
We came to this planet

1527
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,570
想找一个地方避难
looking for a safe place to live,

1528
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,280
可他们却把我关进了牢笼
and they put me in a cage.

1529
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,200
对 地球上确实有很多坏人
Yeah. A lot of humans are dicks.

1530
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,910
但是 地球上
But then

1531
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,540
还有小宝宝和芭蕾舞演员
there's babies and ballerinas.

1532
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,040
还有娱乐摔跤手
And entertainment wrestlers.

1533
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,540
有很多人值得被拯救
A lot of humans are worth saving.

1534
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,920
那是你认为
Maybe to you.

1535
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,540
我不是地球人
But I'm not a human.

1536
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,300
我是氪星人
I'm a Kryptonian.

1537
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,090
她走了
She's gone.

1538
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,640
我必须重获超能力
I have to get my powers back.

1539
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,640
要是能重演那次赋予我能力的意外
If I can re-create the accident that gave me my powers...

1540
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,440
或许我可以重获神速力的青睐
maybe I can reconnect to the Speed Force...

1541
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,900
那样我们就有机会对抗佐德了
and maybe we'd stand a chance against Zod.

1542
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,020
或者 你会在这个过程中丧命
Or kill yourself in the process.

1543
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,200
跟我说说吧
Tell me something.

1544
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,450
如果你真的重获超能力
If you get your powers back,

1545
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:04,080
你哪儿都能去
you can go anywhere.

1546
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:07,290
比如另一条时间线 另一个宇宙
You can go to another timeline, another universe.

1547
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:08,660
为什么要留下
Why do you wanna stay...

1548
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,040
为守护这个世界而战
and fight to save this one?

1549
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,170
因为我的妈妈活在这个世界里
Because this is the world where my mom lives.

1550
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,420
我穿越时空就是为了救她
I went back in time to save her.

1551
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,800
我绝不能再次失去她
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1552
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,680
那孩子不知道吧
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1553
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,180
这种事情要怎么跟他说
How do you tell someone something like that?

1554
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,560
我失去了我的父母 但是
I lost my parents... but

1555
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,770
那种痛苦
that pain...

1556
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:42,160
造就了我
made me who I am.

1557
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,030
没有那种经历 我也许会迷失自我
I'm not sure I know who I am without it, actually.

1558
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,790
我大半辈子
I spent a lifetime...

1559
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,960
都在试图纠正过去的错误
trying to right the wrongs of the past.

1560
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,090
就好像
As if

1561
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:00,220
披着个斗篷打击犯罪
putting on a cape and fighting crime

1562
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,180
就能让我和父母重聚
would bring my parents back.

1563
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,390
可你做到了
You actually did it.

1564
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,680
看来
So...

1565
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,770
你的计划就是
I guess the plan is

1566
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:16,150
泼自己一身化学试剂的同时
to douse yourself in industrial chemicals

1567
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,940
电击你自己
while electrocuting yourself?

1568
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,150
没错
Yep.

1569
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,410
要帮忙吗
Want some help?

1570
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,700
太好了 我很需要你的帮助
Hell yeah.  That would be incredibly useful.

1571
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,410
其实我已经拿了你一些药剂
I've actually already borrowed some chemicals

1572
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,660
还有你的焊铁和耐热垫
and your soldering iron,

1573
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,830
还坐在你的专座上
and I'm sitting in your bat-seat.

1574
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,420
是不是有点儿不礼貌啊
Is that like a faux pas?

1575
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:51,020
W号机 L号机 Z号机 请注意
Wilco, Lima, Zebra, be advised...

1576
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,520
指挥部呼叫B-601号驾驶员
Air Command to Bravo 601.

1577
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:59,020
主力编队 请确认管控范围
Primary teams, please confirm your AORs.

1578
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,300
你竟然空手而来
You bring me nothing?

1579
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,260
我警告过你们
I gave you a warning.

1580
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:31,010
要是你们不能把那个氪星叛徒交给我们
Your failure to deliver the Kryptonian traitor

1581
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,890
就会被视为对我们宣战
is being taken as an act of war.

1582
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,810
开火 开火 开火
Fire, fire, fire!

1583
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:38,060
武器准备就绪 开火
Weapons hot! Weapons hot! Open fire!

1584
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,400
不要
No.

1585
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,560
好了 等我拉动开关
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1586
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:17,390
电流应该就会通过电线 把闪电直接引到风筝上面
the current should run up the wire and draw the lightning right to the kite.

1587
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,940
给 把这个穿上
Here, put that on.

1588
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,770
它不仅耐热 而且能防撞
It's heat and impact resistant.

1589
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:21,900
一点儿保护措施
Should protect you a little.

1590
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,320
关键就在于我不能有任何保护措施
Right, but the point is for me to not be protected.

1591
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,030
好吧
Okay.

1592
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,200
你得离远一点儿
You're gonna need to be out of the way.

1593
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:32,410
好的
I will.

1594
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:37,790
该上电刑了
Let's get electrocuted.

1595
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,050
会成功的 对吧
This is going to work, right?

1596
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,420
当然会成功的
Of course it's gonna work.

1597
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,550
之前又不是没试过
Nothing we haven't done before.

1598
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,430
这次还有蝙蝠侠帮忙
Besides, this time we have Batman.

1599
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:51,680
没问题的
What could go wrong?

1600
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,260
郑重声明 我觉得这很荒唐
Uh, for the record, I think this is insane.

1601
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,140
离远点儿
Get back.

1602
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,270
没事的 没事
It's fine. It's fine.

1603
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,950
我们又见面了 闪电先生
Just you and me again, Mr. Lightning.

1604
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:23,710
动手
Do it!

1605
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,570
等等 什么 不好
Wait, what? No!

1606
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,940
不行 等等 停下
No, wait! Stop!

1607
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,030
停下
Stop!

1608
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:57,660
天啊
Oh, God.

1609
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,160
天啊
Oh, God.

1610
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,790
巴里 不要
Barry, no.

1611
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,210
再来一次
Go again.

1612
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,090
可是
But...

1613
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,460
求你了
Please.

1614
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,260
电路烧坏了
The circuit is fried.

1615
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,780
我来帮你
I've got you.

1616
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,270
喂
Hey.

1617
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:51,650
巴里
Barry.

1618
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,570
你跟上次一样没事 对吧
You're okay. It's like last time, right?

1619
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,530
你快点儿自愈啊
So, you gotta heal now.

1620
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:15,720
看 快看
Look, look, look!

1621
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,220
可以了 成功了
It's working. It's working.

1622
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,720
太好了 成功了
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1623
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,640
太好了 他正在自愈
Yeah, he's healing. He's healing.

1624
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,430
谢天谢地 他没事
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1625
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:25,140
兄弟 你知不知道你差点儿把我吓死
Dude, you scared the shit out of me.

1626
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:10,140
你醒了
You're awake.

1627
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:11,900
感觉如何
How you feeling?

1628
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:13,770
很慢
Slow.

1629
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,190
也许这个能帮你
Maybe this will help.

1630
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,660
完美
Yes!

1631
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:30,920
太酷了 兄弟
Dude, come on!

1632
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,290
真是太酷了
Irresistible!

1633
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:34,040
天啊 重获力量太棒了
Man, feels good to be back.

1634
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:35,090
当然
Yeah!

1635
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,960
不过你穿的这是什么
And what are we wearing tonight?

1636
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:37,840
喜欢吗
You like it?

1637
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,220
我用蝙蝠侠的那套旧战服改的
I-I made it myself out of that old Batsuit.

1638
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,430
改成了咱们战服的颜色和款式
But you know, I made it our colors and everything.

1639
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:43,640
对了 你看这个
Well, check this out!

1640
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,640
这身比较宽松
It's a bit more loose.

1641
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,180
爆炫
It beeves.

1642
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,190
兄弟
Dude...

1643
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,020
你真这么觉得吗
you really mean that?

1644
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,150
说实话
I mean, I don't...

1645
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:59,320
其实我不知道“爆炫”是什么意思
I don't know what it means, exactly, to beeve.

1646
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,910
不过听起来是个好词
But it seems like it's positive.

1647
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,070
你怎么了
What are you doing?

1648
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,080
你回来了
You came back.

1649
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:08,660
很高兴你没事
I'm glad you're okay.

1650
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,290
我有个问题想问你
I have to ask you something.

1651
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:14,670
你在我被囚禁的地方找到我的时候
When you found me in that hole that they put me in...

1652
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,670
发现我不是卡尔-艾尔
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1653
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,670
为什么还要帮我
why did you help me?

1654
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,680
因为你需要帮助
Because you needed help.

1655
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,390
你知道这个符号代表什么吗
Do you know what this symbol stands for?

1656
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,390
超级少女
Supergirl?

1657
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:31,640
是希望 对吧
It means hope, right?

1658
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,190
希望 对 是希望吗
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1659
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:36,770
氪星是一个美丽的星球
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1660
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:40,320
我们的特质是希望
We are a people of hope,

1661
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:42,200
不是战争
not war.

1662
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,280
这里是来自大都会的直播 就在几分钟之前
I'm coming to you live from Metropolis, where minutes ago, the mysterious flying...

1663
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,040
佐德虽然是氪星人
Zod may be from Krypton,

1664
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,830
但他绝对不能代表我们
but he is not my people.

1665
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:54,580
那你的意思是
So, you're saying...

1666
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:55,670
是的
Yes.

1667
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,840
我会帮你们对抗佐德
I will help you fight Zod.

1668
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,800
太好了
Yes!

1669
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,340
这队伍有点儿意思
Interesting group.

1670
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,510
你之前说
What did you say, uh...

1671
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:08,680
我们叫什么来着
we were called again?

1672
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:10,640
我们是正义联盟
We're the Justice League.

1673
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,770
不对
No.

1674
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:12,890
不对吗 不过
-No? -Well,

1675
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,890
也算是吧
I mean, kinda.

1676
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,940
我们还缺
We are short

1677
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,270
一个真正的女神
one literal goddess...

1678
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,020
一个笑面终结者
one friendly Terminator

1679
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,900
一个超级人鱼
and super mermaid.

1680
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,900
当然蝙蝠侠也是必不可少的
And we could definitely use a Batman.

1681
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:29,030
你来吗
Are you in?

1682
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:35,830
想大干一场
You wanna get nuts?

1683
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,420
那就来吧
Let's get nuts.

1684
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:55,440
在我来的世界 佐德一召唤超人就立刻现身了
In my world, Superman showed up right away when Zod called him out.

1685
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,900
所以说我也不知道接下来会发生什么
So, as of now, we're in uncharted territory.

1686
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:58,900
但是我知道
What I do know is

1687
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,150
佐德以某种方式控制着创世引擎
that Zod somehow controls the World Engines,

1688
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,280
它的破坏力非常惊人
which will be destroying much more

1689
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,030
我们每晚一秒阻止他
than just Metropolis now

1690
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:06,030
他就能摧毁一座规模相当于大都会的城市
with every passing second that we don't stop him.

1691
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:07,200
巴里 你在干什么
Barry, what are you doing?

1692
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,280
什么
What?

1693
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,330
咱们的孩子们肯定想看
Our kids are gonna wanna see this.

1694
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:12,700
你有孩子
Your kids?

1695
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:16,040
我是说所有的孩子
Well, you know, like everybody's kids.

1696
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,540
全世界所有的小孩儿
I mean, the children of the world.

1697
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:18,920
他们肯定想看
They're gonna wanna see this.

1698
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,670
我们马上就到了
We're getting close.

1699
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,300
我负责空中作战 消灭他们的空中力量
I'm gonna stay airborne and take out their sky power.

1700
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,340
巴里 这也就意味着
And Barry, just so we're clear

1701
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,760
你和我两个人要对抗地面上的整个氪星人大军
what that essentially equates to is you and me versus the entire Kryptonian army.

1702
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:30,890
好的
Chill.

1703
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:33,260
我们要给卡拉争取时间 让她击败佐德
We need to buy Kara enough time to take out Zod.

1704
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:36,390
别忘了你的战服不能像我的一样耗散能量
Oh, and remember that your suit doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1705
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,440
所以你不能一直跑 否则会积累过多的电荷
so you need to take breaks, otherwise you're gonna build up too much charge.

1706
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:40,770
等等 什么
Wait, what?

1707
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:02,710
抓稳
Hold on!

1708
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,420
稳住
Hold on.

1709
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,050
这就是我们要保护的人吗
The humans we came to protect?

1710
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:11,640
他们不知道我们是友军
They don't know we're on their side.

1711
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,960
佐德
Zod.

1712
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,520
卡拉佐-艾尔
Kara Zor-El.

1713
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,310
终于把你等来了
We've been waiting for you.

1714
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:12,410
把他拖走 你上 我来掩护
-Drag him out, drag him! -You go! I'll cover!

1715
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:32,720
等一下 那个来自太空的巨怪
Okay, and the space giant...

1716
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,430
还有那个女杀人狂 也要我们对付吗
and Mistress Murder... are our responsibility, too?

1717
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,060
别去想他们 冷静下来
Don't think about them, okay? Calm down.

1718
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,680
我们先解决那边的敌人
We're just gonna start with those guys over there.

1719
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:42,020
没错 他们都是氪星人 我们干不掉
And yeah, they're Kryptonian, and we won't be able to kill them,

1720
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,810
但我们可以帮卡拉拖住他们
but we can slow them down for her.

1721
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,020
一个一个来
One at a time.

1722
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:46,810
好吗
Okay?

1723
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:49,280
我先去打掉他们的武器 然后你再上
I'm gonna disarm them, and then you'll engage.

1724
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:52,190
揍他们
Punch 'em.

1725
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,910
走吧 芭比
Come on, Barbie.

1726
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,030
去派对狂欢
Let's go party?

1727
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,290
糟糕
Okay, ow!

1728
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:15,180
好了 没事了
Okay. It's okay.

1729
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,390
你没事 快起来
You're okay. Come on.

1730
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,390
天啊 他们太快了
Jesus, they're fast.

1731
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,270
没错 但是不如我们快
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1732
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:25,690
地球的改造已经开始
Terraforming has begun.

1733
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:27,440
只有这个世界灭亡
This world must die

1734
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,520
我们那个世界才能重生
so that ours may live again.

1735
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,030
不好 我们快走 快走
Oh, my God. We gotta go. We gotta go.

1736
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,160
丹尼 走
Dan, Danny, go,

1737
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,200
走
go!

1738
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,410
氪星已经灭亡了 佐德
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1739
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,540
你的叔叔
Your uncle...

1740
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,920
乔-艾尔
Jor-El...

1741
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:49,420
把氪星
hid the key

1742
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,670
能够重生的关键
to Krypton's rebirth

1743
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,550
藏在了一个氪星孩子身上
inside a Kryptonian child.

1744
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,260
他把重启氪星生命所必需的基因资料
All the genetic material needed to start again

1745
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:00,890
编码进了他的DNA
coded inside the DNA,

1746
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:03,640
然后用逃生舱 把他送来了地球
then sent to Earth in an escape pod.

1747
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,020
他不在这里 你已经失败了
He's not here. You have failed.

1748
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,940
我们找到他了
We found him.

1749
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:11,900
我们拦截了他的逃生舱
We intercepted his pod.

1750
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,820
但你那个堂弟并不是我们要找的人
But your cousin was not the one we needed.

1751
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:20,160
你才是那个人
You are the one.

1752
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:21,910
卡拉佐-艾尔
Kara Zor-El.

1753
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,660
我们需要的
It is your blood...

1754
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:25,410
是你的血液
we must harvest.

1755
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:26,920
你们把卡尔-艾尔怎么了
What did you do to Kal-El?

1756
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,170
你的牺牲将会让我们的氪星
Your sacrifice that will allow

1757
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:31,710
重获新生
Krypton to live again.

1758
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:34,050
你们到底做了什么
What did you do?

1759
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:37,720
那个孩子
The infant did

1760
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,550
并没有活下来
not survive.

1761
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,210
听着 新计划
Look, new plan.

1762
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,840
我来制造一阵龙卷风
I'm gonna create a cyclonic diversion.

1763
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,670
然后你发动进攻 用全力
And you're gonna just come in, hard.

1764
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,930
这次直接用脚踹
Feet first this time.

1765
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:35,650
漂亮
Yes!

1766
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,900
巴里 你看到了吗
Barry, did you see that?

1767
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,950
小心 你积累的电荷太多了
Be careful. You're accumulating too much charge.

1768
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,660
要是我发射电流攻击这家伙呢
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1769
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,830
不行 快住手
No, no, no!

1770
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,070
巴里 刚才那招并没有我想的那么蠢
Barry, that was actually only half stupid!

1771
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:18,070
但是 如果你想活着继续用那招
But if you're gonna do that and not die,

1772
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,650
你需要想办法组成电回路
you need to complete the circuit somehow.

1773
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,280
试着把手放在一起 像这样
Try putting your hands together, like this.

1774
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:26,070
糟了
Oh, shit.

1775
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:28,830
你可以的
You're ready.

1776
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:31,160
冲啊
Let's go!

1777
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:33,330
歌词大意 来吧

1778
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,590
我好像遇到了一点儿麻烦
? I seem to think I think I got a little situation ?

1779
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,890
所以听我说
? So listen to me,

1780
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:47,640
或许你能帮上忙
sister Listen maybe you can help ?

1781
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,520
我对许多问题都有自己的思考
? I think I gave a lot of Problems my consideration ?

1782
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,390
但我似乎总在为别人考虑
? But not for me It always seem to be For someone else ?

1783
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,150
为什么其他人好像总在休假
? Why all the people always Seem to just be on vacation ?

1784
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:59,030
我得到什么好处了吗 什么都没有
? What do I get from it I don't get anything at all ?

1785
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,150
我就像一个装着各种负能量的垃圾桶
? I'm like a trash can Holding all the information ?

1786
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,950
这种感觉让我无地自容
? And every single time It leaves me Feeling two feet tall ?

1787
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:16,670
只有一种答案 只有一种答案
? And only one I'm taking ?

1788
01:48:47,530 --> 01:48:48,950
我去对付那个大家伙
I'm going after the big one.

1789
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:01,210
我被击中了
I've been hit.

1790
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,090
布鲁斯 能听到吗
Bruce, do you copy?

1791
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,720
卡拉呢
Where's Kara?

1792
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,930
你快去找她
You go find her.

1793
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,520
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1794
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,770
弹射模式 故障
Ejection mode failure. Ejection mode failure.

1795
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:00,060
安息吧 卡拉佐-艾尔
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1796
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:06,820
我要坠毁了
Going down.

1797
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:13,280
但我还要拉个垫背的
But I'm not going alone.

1798
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:14,540
不 不要
No, no, no,

1799
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,580
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1800
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,410
布鲁斯 快弹射
Bruce, eject!

1801
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,920
布鲁斯 赶紧弹
Bruce, just eject...

1802
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,170
不
No!

1803
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,020
卡拉
Kara.

1804
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,440
这种事不应该
Isn't supposed...

1805
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:51,570
不应该发生的
Not supposed to happen...

1806
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,040
卡拉死了
Kara's dead.

1807
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,580
他们都死了
They're both dead.

1808
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,290
但还有办法 对吧
But they don't have to be, right?

1809
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:05,040
因为我们可以穿越
'Cause we can go back.

1810
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:06,420
就像你之前那样
Like you did.

1811
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,670
你的速度还不够快
You're not fast enough yet.

1812
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,800
是吗
You sure?

1813
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,680
巴里
Barry!

1814
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,390
巴里 等等
Barry, wait!

1815
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,150
到这儿够了吗
Is this back enough?

1816
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,780
我觉得够了
Yeah, I guess so.

1817
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,040
听着 巴里 我
Listen, Barry, I...

1818
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,410
怎么了
What?

1819
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:44,920
没事的 我们肯定能搞定
It's okay. We can fix this.

1820
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:48,050
你知道怎么做吗 我已经想好做什么了
You know what you're gonna change? I know what I'm gonna change.

1821
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:54,800
我去对付那个大家伙
I'm going after the big one.

1822
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:59,390
布鲁斯 先别打 那艘战舰外面有护盾
Bruce, pull off. That gunship is shield-protected.

1823
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,520
收到
Roger that.

1824
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,190
他肯定没有
Bet he's not.

1825
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:06,900
谁
Who?

1826
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,020
那个太空巨怪
Space giant?

1827
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,070
没错 赶紧把他干掉
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1828
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:52,190
太好了
Yes.

1829
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:46,390
好了

1830
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,190
我来了

1831
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,810
别
No.

1832
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,400
你会好的
It'll be okay.

1833
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,280
这次不行了
Not this time, kid.

1834
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,320
别的时间线也许行
Maybe some other time.

1835
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,210
我们救不了你 是吗
We can't bring you back, can we?

1836
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:13,170
你已经救过了
You already did.

1837
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:16,550
已经救过了
You already did.

1838
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:28,390
来吧 巴里
Come on, Barry.

1839
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,060
快起来啊 快啊
Gotta get up. Come on.

1840
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:31,940

再来一次
We go again.

1842
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:36,150
巴里
Barry.

1843
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,780
我们走吧
Let's just go.

1844
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:42,070
巴里 好了 我们快走
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1845
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,660
巴里 这样做毫无意义
Barry, there's no point.

1846
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:47,410
巴里
Barry!

1847
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,390
共振
Phase!

1848
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,060
来 我帮你拔出来
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1849
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:17,820
不用 我没事 我得把它拔出来
-I have to pull it out. -No, I'm okay.

1850
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,900
我没事 我应该早点儿停下的 巴里 用共振
You have to phase again. Barry, phase again. I'm okay. I just should've stopped sooner.

1851
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,840
再来
Again.

1852
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,670
巴里
Barry.

1853
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:52,140
等等 我们能不能先停一下
Okay, can we please just take a minute?

1854
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,310
抱歉 伙计
Sorry, dude.

1855
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,060
兄弟 当然可以了
Yeah, bro, of course.

1856
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,310
这是我们的能力
That's the whole thing.

1857
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,570
想停多久 我们就能停多久
We can take as much time as it takes.

1858
01:56:58,650 --> 01:56:59,440
不 不是
No,

1859
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,030
我不是那个意思 我
that's not what I mean. Hey!

1860
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:23,920
怎么样 好点儿了吗
Okay, you good?

1861
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,800
走吧 我需要你帮忙
Come on. I need you in there.

1862
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,680
快来吧
Let's go.

1863
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,470
巴里 拜托 先听我说
Barry, please, just listen to me!

1864
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,530
你去哪儿了
Where were you?

1865
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:49,450
你一直都站在这里没动吗
What, you just stand here the whole time?

1866
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,330
巴里
Barry,

1867
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:52,450
这是一个无法避免的交汇点
this is an inevitable intersection.

1868
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,540
快点儿停手吧 巴里
You have to stop. Barry!

1869
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,140
不 巴里 等等
No, Barry, wait!

1870
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:18,270
听着 巴里
Barry, listen.

1871
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:20,560
我有话要对你说
There's something I should tell you.

1872
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,280
我一开始尝试回到过去
I went back in time initially

1873
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:26,530
是因为
because...

1874
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:28,030
是因为妈妈死了
Yeah, because Mom died.

1875
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:29,660
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1876
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:30,910
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

1877
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,160
不是吗
Does it?

1878
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,660
我必须纠正我犯下的错
You know that I have to undo what I did.

1879
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,330
不
No.

1880
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:37,410
你没有做错
It's not a mistake.

1881
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,670
我们能救她
We can save her.

1882
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,040
也可以救他们
And we can save them.

1883
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:41,420
我们救不了
No, we can't.

1884
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,050
这就是布鲁斯之前所说的
This is what Bruce was talking about.

1885
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:45,920
巴里 这无法避免
Barry, this is inevitable.

1886
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,920
我们就算尝试一百万次
We can try a million times,

1887
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:49,680
也没办法改变这一切
and we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1888
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,550
无论我们做什么
No matter what we do...

1889
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:54,010
世界都会灭亡
this world dies.

1890
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:56,010
就在今天
Today.

1891
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:58,180
你自己看看
Look around.

1892
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:04,520
我们把这里搞得一团糟
Look at the damage we're causing.

1893
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,660
现在必须停手了 好吗
Now we have to stop. Okay?

1894
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,910
听着 我本来只是回家洗衣服
Look, I was just doing my laundry.

1895
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:16,040
是你突然出现
You're the one who came

1896
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,040
跟我说我是一个超级英雄
and told me that I'm a superhero.

1897
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,960
现在 你又是什么意思
And now you're saying what?

1898
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,540
你又不想让我当了
You don't want me to be?

1899
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,920
不好意思 现在太晚了
Well, guess what! It's too late!

1900
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,050
我就是
I am...

1901
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:28,300
闪电侠
...the Flash.

1902
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:30,220
我可以拯救所有人
And I can save everyone.

1903
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:31,970
谁都不会死
Nobody dies!

1904
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:33,050
巴里
Barry...

1905
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:37,020
有些问题注定无解
not every problem has a solution.

1906
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:47,940
有些问题注定无解
Not every problem has a solution.

1907
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:53,280
有时我们只能放弃
Sometimes we just have to let go.

1908
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:55,450
有时候你只能放弃
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1909
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,780
放弃
Let go

1910
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,290
救妈妈
of Mom?

1911
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:02,040
这么多条时间线 总有一条妈妈会活着
She'll always be alive, somewhere in time.

1912
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,960
一定会
Always.

1913
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,840
但不是这一条
Just not for us.

1914
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,550
简直胡说八道
You're full of shit, dude.

1915
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:10,170
我要回去了
I'm going back.

1916
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:12,340
你要回去让妈妈死吗
You're going back to kill Mom?

1917
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,430
不行
No!

1918
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:14,800
你不能走
You're staying!

1919
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:17,760
别走 待在这儿
You stay, right here.

1920
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,430
就让我再试一次
Just give me one more time.

1921
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:22,190
巴里 站住
Barry, stop!

1922
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,270
你站住
You, stop!

1923
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:58,010
初次见面不太愉快
Feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

1924
02:00:58,510 --> 02:00:59,510
重新认识一下
Let's start again.

1925
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:01,020
我是闪电侠
I'm the Flash.

1926
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:02,390
你叫什么
What's your name?

1927
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,810
我的经历
I've lived...

1928
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:06,400
超乎你的想象
more than you can dream.

1929
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:08,440
答非所问
Not an answer.

1930
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,530
你是在背台词吗
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1931
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:19,530
快离开这儿 巴里
Get out of here, Barry!

1932
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:35,930
那个伤疤 你
That scar, you...

1933
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:38,550
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1934
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:40,140
你是
So, you're...

1935
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:41,510
你是
You are...

1936
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,180
没错 我就是
Yes, I am...

1937
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:44,770
你
you.

1938
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:49,150
马上就成功了
We are so close.

1939
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,520
我就要弄清楚了
I've got it almost figured out.

1940
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:54,690
你这样做有多长时间了
How long have you been doing this?

1941
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,780
多长时间并不重要
Time is inconsequential.

1942
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,660
来吧 巴里
Come on, Barry.

1943
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,170
快看天上 有只鸟
Up in the sky! It's a bird!

1944
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:11,790
那是飞机
It's a plane!

1945
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,420
是超人
It's Superman!

1946
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:57,550
绝对万无一失
Purrfectly foolproof.

1947
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:00,840
只有小丑会这么想
Only the Joker would think of that.

1948
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:41,430
看看正在发生的这一切
Please just look at what's happening.

1949
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:44,140
这些世界
These worlds...

1950
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,770
正在相互冲撞和崩毁
...they're colliding and collapsing.

1951
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,650
这都怪我们
We did this.

1952
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:02,910
我们正在破坏万物的结构
W-We're destroying the fabric of everything.

1953
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,410
你必须马上停手
You have to stop.

1954
02:04:06,450 --> 02:04:09,330
等我成功了 这些就都会停了
It stops once I've fixed it!

1955
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,920
这也不全是你的错 巴里
It's not entirely your fault, Barry.

1956
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:17,300
9月29日那天 是我把你推出了时空之碗
I pushed you out of the Chronobowl on that September 29

1957
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,460
让你帮我踏上了这条路
so you could start me on this path.

1958
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:23,050
你觉得我们这个悖论怎么样
How do you like our endless paradox?

1959
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:25,800
是我本人让你创造了我
I made you create me...

1960
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:28,180
而现在你却成了
and now you're the one...

1961
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:30,640
我的阻碍
in my way.

1962
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:33,900
无论我多么接近打赢这场战斗
No matter how close I get to winning this fight...

1963
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,020
你都会回去
you go back

1964
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,820
导致妈妈死去
and let Mom die.

1965
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:40,820
你才是不可避免的交汇点
You're the inevitable intersection.

1966
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,950
你确实需要放手
And you do have to let go.

1967
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:45,160
他是什么意思
What's he talking about?

1968
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,030
你是我的英雄
You're my hero.

1969
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:02,550
你这是干什么
What did you do?

1970
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,970
别害怕 会愈合的
Hey, hey. Don't worry. It's gonna heal.

1971
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,300
会愈合的
It's gonna heal.

1972
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,260
我刚才是想
I just wanted to...

1973
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:26,070
巴里

1974
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:28,580
告诉妈妈我爱她
You tell Mom I love her.

1975
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,560
别忘了这罐西红柿
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1976
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,830
我小时候特别爱吃这种麦片
I used to love that cereal when I was a kid.

1977
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,540
是吧
Yeah.

1978
02:06:59,290 --> 02:07:00,830
我儿子也特别喜欢吃
My son goes nuts for it.

1979
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:06,340
可惜要停产了
They stop making it.

1980
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:08,720
我听到消息说
Well, I know they were talking

1981
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,800
这种麦片就要停产了
about discontinuing it.

1982
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,680
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

1983
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,680
不 我平时不住这附近
No, I'm not from around here.

1984
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:14,140
我是来看妈妈的
I was just visiting my mom.

1985
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,890
没准我认识她
Maybe I know her.

1986
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:17,060
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

1987
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,390
她是天底下最好
She's the best...

1988
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:22,940
也是最善良的人
and kindest person in the world.

1989
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:23,940
你还好吗
You okay?

1990
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:25,150
嗯 我就是
Yeah, I'm just...

1991
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:27,190
我会想她的
I'm really gonna miss her.

1992
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:52,180
我知道 我只是超市里的一个陌生阿姨
I know I'm just... a random lady in a store.

1993
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,550
要我抱抱你吗
But do you want a hug?

1994
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,220
好
Sure.

1995
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,400
对不起
I'm sorry.

1996
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,560
不要这么说
Oh, don't say that.

1997
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:08,690
你特意来看妈妈 她一定特别感动
Your mom must be grateful you came to visit her.

1998
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:10,950
有你是她的福气
She's very lucky to have you.

1999
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:20,290
有她是我的福气
I'm very lucky to have her.

2000
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:23,460
那你可得亲口告诉她
You have to tell her that.

2001
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:26,340
当妈妈的就喜欢听这样的话
Moms like to hear these kind of things.

2002
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:28,170
相信我吧
Believe me.

2003
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:36,680
歌词大意 世界离我越来越远

2004
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:43,140
虽然我的身体已经不在了

2005
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:54,410
世界离我越来越远

2006
02:08:54,450 --> 02:08:58,580
我把灵魂留在了这里

2007
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:04,420
来这里找她

2008
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:08,540
我爱你 妈妈
Love you, Mom.

2009
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:17,800
我爱你更多
I love you more.

2010
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:21,810
我爱你更早
I loved you first.

2011
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,650
再见
Bye.

2012
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:28,900
再见
Bye.

2013
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:43,660
（西红柿罐头）

2014
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:03,140
我回来了
I'm back.

2015
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:13,650
（不确定你什么时候回来 庭审现场见 艾瑞斯）

2016
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:14,780
该死
Shit!

2017
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:16,400
庭审
Court!

2018
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:28,420
在此前的庭审中 被认定为
...original trial was initially...

2019
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:32,670
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

2020
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,800
（法官）

2021
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:38,840
正如我刚才所说
As I was saying...

2022
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:42,640
这条编号为F的录像证据在此前的庭审中
the same security camera footage, Exhibit F in the original trial,

2023
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:43,680
（证据F）

2024
02:10:43,890 --> 02:10:45,890
被认定为无效证据
was initially considered useless,

2025
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:47,640
但是这一次
but has now

2026

提高了画面质量
from Wayne Enterprises.

2028
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,280
录像内容印证了
It confirms the alibi

2029
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:58,820
艾伦先生的不在场证明
Mr. Allen has argued,

2030
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,660
也和他儿子 巴里
and his son, Barry,

2031
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:04,580
当年的口供完全一致

2032
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:10,040
（证据F 修复后）

02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:11,540
请看
Here.

2034
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:18,340
大家可以清楚地看到 被告人艾伦先生
Right here, you can clearly see my client, Mr. Allen,

2035
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,390
正从货架最上层拿取西红柿罐头
reaching for a can of tomatoes on the top shelf.

2036
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:43,530
艾伦先生 您可以 再跟我们讲讲之前发生的事吗
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us a bit more about what happened, please?

2037
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:45,290
关于这个
Well, um...

2038
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:48,710
西红柿从货架最底层移到了最上层
the tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to the top shelf,

2039
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:50,040
也就导致了
and subsequently,

2040
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:52,540
煮熟的意面又变生了
uncooked the spaghetti.

2041
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:54,420
说完了
Unquote.

2042
02:11:56,670 --> 02:11:58,300
抱歉 您刚刚说的是什么啊
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no sense.

2043
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:59,550
这是什么意思 先生
What are you talking about, sir?

2044

We're good here. Thank you.

2047
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,140
我刚才讲得还行吗
Did I give a good quote?

2048
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,890
当然 尤其是意面那句
Yeah. Spaghetti.

2049
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:13,650
既然说到了吃的 我在想
Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking, um...

2050
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,320
你应该约我吃饭
you should ask me to dinner.

2051
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:19,320
和我吃晚饭
D-Dinner with me?

2052
02:12:19,690 --> 02:12:21,700
没错 约会 巴里
Yes, a date, Barry.

2053
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:23,820
艾瑞斯 可以共进晚餐吗
Iris West, do you wanna dinner-date me?

2054
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:25,530

I'd love to.

2055
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:26,580

Thank you.

2056
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,040

I'd love to also.

2057
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,040
打给我
Call me.

2058
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,420
歌词大意 生活真的会给人惊喜

2059
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:44,180
天啊 生活真会给人惊喜

2060
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:50,890

2061
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:52,190

谢谢
Thank you.

2064
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:56,520
你可不知道我听见你的声音有多高兴
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.

2065
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:59,030
等下次见了面 我有好多事要跟你讲
I... I have so much to tell you the next time I see you, Bruce.

2066
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:01,400
你说得对 是我没把你的话当真
You were right. Okay? And I didn't listen.

2067
02:13:01,530 --> 02:13:03,280
结果事情发展得非常 非常离谱
And things did get very, very weird,

2068
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,410
但是我把一切都恢复了 我向你保证
but I put everything back, I promise.

先生 请您看镜头
- Back up, please. - Shot!

2073
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:20,920
这和您受到的指控有关联吗
Was it backed by your own allegation?

2074
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,220
见鬼了 这又是谁
Who the fuck is this?

2075
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,050
抱歉 韦恩先生今天不接受采访
He's not answering any questions.

2076
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:27,930
请大家退后

02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:41,570
你失忆了吗
What's wrong with you?
